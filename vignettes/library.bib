  abstract = {While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  journal = {Animal Behaviour}, 
  abstract = {All animals sleep and it is essential for maintaining optimal brain function. However, cetaceans engage in the unusual practice of unihemispherical sleep, where only half of their brain sleeps at a time, due to their constant need for movement and breathing. Most studies of sleep in cetaceans have occurred in captivity. However, tagging devices have now developed to the point where the data collected from wild animals can be assessed against published criteria for defining sleep behaviourally. Seven acoustic and behavioural data loggers were deployed on harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Danish waters between May 2010 and August 2011 and stayed on the animals between 53 and 72h, recording 1884 to 2755 valid dives per animal. Parabolic dives with significantly reduced bioacoustic activity and a stereotyped behavioural pattern were identified as potential sleeping periods. The recordings for nearly half of the parabolic dives were found to contain no vocalization (echolocation clicks), significantly more than other dive types. Of the remaining parabolic dives, the click rate was, when normalized to their individual means, also significantly lower than detected in other dive types. Additionally, parabolic dives were shallow compared to all other dive types, and found to have a stereotypic low-energy profile. They were also found to contain fewer rolls and incorporate a lower vertical descent rate than most other dive types. If the data are representative, harbour porpoises spend a small, but meaningful amount of their diving time engaged in parabolic dives and thus potentially sleeping. All animals have a fundamental need for undisturbed sleep. These quiet periods thus need to be considered in studies of anthropogenic effects, but also those employing passive acoustic monitoring techniques, as well as in efforts to reduce incidental bycatch in fisheries, given the associated periods of reduced environmental awareness.},

  abstract = {Adequate conservation and management of shark populations is becoming increasingly important on a global scale, especially because many species are exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing. Yet, reported catch statistics for sharks are incomplete, and mortality estimates have not been available for sharks as a group. Here, the global catch and mortality of sharks from reported and unreported landings, discards, and shark finning are being estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for the year 2000, and at only slightly less in 2010 (1.41 million tons). Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Further, the exploitation rate for sharks as a group was calculated by dividing two independent mortality estimates by an estimate of total global biomass. As an alternative approach, exploitation rates for individual shark populations were compiled and averaged from stock assessments and other published sources. The resulting three independent estimates of the average exploitation rate ranged between 6.4\% and 7.9\% of sharks killed per year. This exceeds the average rebound rate for many shark populations, estimated from the life history information on 62 shark species (rebound rates averaged 4.9\% per year), and explains the ongoing declines in most populations for which data exist. The consequences of these unsustainable catch and mortality rates for marine ecosystems could be substantial. Global total shark mortality, therefore, needs to be reduced drastically in order to rebuild depleted populations and restore marine ecosystems with functional top predators.},

  journal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association}, 
  abstract = {We develop scalable methods for fitting penalized regression spline based generalized additive models with of the order of 104 coefficients to up to 108 data. Computational feasibility rests on: (i) a new iteration scheme for estimation of model coefficients and smoothing parameters, avoiding poorly scaling matrix operations; (ii) parallelization of the iteration’s pivoted block Cholesky and basic matrix operations; (iii) the marginal discretization of model covariates to reduce memory footprint, with efficient scalable methods for computing required crossproducts directly from the discrete representation. Marginal discretization enables much finer discretization than joint discretization would permit. We were motivated by the need to model four decades worth of daily particulate data from the UK Black Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide monitoring network. Although reduced in size recently, over 2000 stations have at some time been part of the network, resulting in some 10 million measurements. Modelling at a daily scale is desirable for accurate trend estimation and mapping, and to provide daily exposure estimates for epidemiological cohort studies. Because of the data set size, previous work has focussed on modelling time or space averages pollution levels, but this is unsatisfactory from a health perspective, since it is often acute exposure locally and on the time scale of days that is of most importance in driving adverse health outcomes. If computed by conventional means our black smoke model would require a half terabyte of storage just for the model matrix, whereas we are able to compute with it on a desktop workstation. The best previously available reduced memory footprint method would have required three orders of magnitude more computing time than our new method.},

The methods use iterative update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling problems.},

Here, we present a new HMM-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields—satellite SST and temperatures derived from the MARS3D hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags (DSTs) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.},

  journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Failure to account for time‐varying detection ranges when inferring space use of marine species from passive acoustic telemetry data can bias estimates and result in erroneous biological conclusions. This potential source of bias is widely acknowledged but often ignored in practice due to a lack of available statistical methods. Here, we describe and apply a spatial point process model for estimating individual centres of activity (COAs) from acoustic telemetry data that can be modified to account for both receiver‐ and time‐specific detection probabilities. We use simulation testing to evaluate the suitability of the proposed models for estimating COAs and compare their performance to that of the popular mean‐weighted COA method for a variety of scenarios. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to correct for variable detection ranges by integrating data from moored test tags and demonstrate how accounting for time‐varying detection probabilities can impact space use estimates by fitting the model to data collected from a black sea bass (Centropristis striata) on a receiver array off the east coast of the United States. The proposed model reduced bias in COA estimates, particularly when tagged individuals occurred along the periphery of the receiver array. The test tag‐integrated model largely corrected the bias associated with receiver‐ and time‐specific detection probabilities. When applied to the black sea bass detection data, the model revealed fine‐scale movements not apparent when detection ranges were assumed constant. Spatial management practices for coastal marine species are often based on trends in space use inferred from passive acoustic telemetry data, which can be misinterpreted when factors influencing detection ranges are not accounted for. Our approach provides a general framework for estimating individual COAs that can be modified on a study‐specific basis to ensure resulting patterns of space use reflect a species’ movements and behaviour, rather than variation in receiver detection ranges.},

In our experiments, increasing the sampling interval led to an underestimation of the number of dives performed, an overestimation in mean dive duration and substantial changes in the form of the dive profile. Our analysis indicates that depth data should be recorded at a minimum rate corresponding to 10\% of the total dive duration and that conventional dive profile categorization may be inappropriate. Alternatives that are less subjective, and based on curve fits of dive depth versus time, are proposed.},

While for some taxa, a great deal of information is known regarding the mechanistic underpinnings of these social processes, knowledge of these mechanisms in elasmobranchs is lacking. Here, we used an integrative and novel combination of direct observation, accelerometer biologgers, and recent advances in network analysis to better understand the mechanistic bases of individual-level differences in sociality (leadership, network attributes) and diel patterns of locomotor activity in a widespread marine predator, the lemon shark ( Negaprion brevirostris ). We found that dynamic models of interaction based on Markov chains can accurately predict juvenile lemon shark social behavior and that lemon sharks did not occupy consistent positions within their network. Lemon sharks did however preferentially associate with specific group members, by sex as well as by similarity or nonsimilarity for a number of behavioral (nonsimilarity: leadership) and locomotor traits (similarity: proportion of time swimming “fast,” mean swim duration; nonsimilarity: proportion of swimming bursts/transitions between activity states). Our study provides some of the first information on the mechanistic bases of group living and personality in sharks and further, a potential experimental approach for studying fine-scale differences in behavior and locomotor patterns in difficult-to-study organisms.},

  abstract = {Animals respond to environmental variation by exhibiting a number of different behaviours and/or rates of activity, which result in corresponding variation in energy expenditure. Successful animals generally maximize efficiency or rate of energy gain through foraging. Quantification of all features that modulate energy expenditure can theoretically be modelled as an animal energetic niche or power envelope; with total power being represented by the vertical axis and n-dimensional horizontal axes representing extents of processes that affect energy expenditure. Such an energetic niche could be used to assess the energetic consequences of animals adopting particular behaviours under various environmental conditions. This value of this approach was tested by constructing a simple mechanistic energetics model based on data collected from recording devices deployed on 41 free-living Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), foraging from four different colonies in Argentina and consequently catching four different types of prey. Energy expenditure was calculated as a function of total distance swum underwater (horizontal axis 1) and maximum depth reached (horizontal axis 2). The resultant power envelope was invariant, irrespective of colony location, but penguins from the different colonies tended to use different areas of the envelope. The different colony solutions appeared to represent particular behavioural options for exploiting the available prey and demonstrate how penguins respond to environmental circumstance (prey distribution), the energetic consequences that this has for them, and how this affects the balance of energy acquisition through foraging and expenditure strategy.},

We explored the relative effectiveness of seasonal closures versus size-based landing restrictions using a four-season age-structured model. More than a third of adult thornback rays are currently removed by fishing each year, and without effective management, a further 90\% decline within 30 years is likely. A three-season closure of the Thames Estuary was the shortest closure that ensured thornback ray recovery and minimal loss of fishery yield. Minimum and maximum landing size restrictions are nearly as effective at recovering thornback rays but less so at improving yield. While long seasonal closures and full marine protected areas are more effective at ensuring the recovery of thornback rays, length restrictions may be simpler to implement under the current institutional framework and may have less impact on the multispecies trawl fisheries operating in the area.},

One of the most important factors to consider when assessing a predator's impact on their ecosystem is metabolic rate, which is dependent on a number of environmental factors including temperature, as well as underlying physiological and anatomical characteristics. Here the standard (SMR) and routine metabolic rates (RMR) and swimming dynamics of the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Bonaterre) were assessed using a static respirometer over two experimental temperatures (23 and 30°C). The metabolic rates measured here represent the lowest reported for any shark species to date. Mean (±SD) SMRs at 23°C and 30°C were 36±8 and 60±17mgO2kg−1h−1, and mean RMRs were 95±15 and 138±21mgO2kg−1h−1, respectively. The Q10 for SMR was 2.42 between 23 and 30°C. Minimum cost of transport (COTmin) at 23°C was 68mgO2kg−1km−1, where swimming speed was 0.33BLs−1. The COTmin increased to 81mgO2kg−1km−1 at 30°C, where swimming speed was 0.44BLs−1. The proportional cost of activity, or the cost of activity relative to SMR, was greater compared to other elasmobranchs, and nearly twice that of most ram ventilating shark species. These results highlight the sedentary nature of nurse sharks and suggest that they are energetically suited for a minimally active lifestyle.},

  abstract = { Climate and weather-based drivers of shark movement are poorly known, yet vital for determining measures for effective conservation of shark populations and the management of shark-human interactions at different time scales. The bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, an IUCN ‘Near-threatened’ species, is globally distributed in subtropical to tropical regions and is implicated in many attacks on humans because of its euryhaline habitat-use. However, drivers determining rapid transitions of this species among habitats along the freshwater-estuarine-marine continuum are yet to be fully understood. To identify triggers for movement by this species into beach areas we used conditional (binomial and gamma) generalised linear modelling (CGLM) of historical bull shark catches from the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) collected from 1996 to 2007 across 1783 km of the Queensland coastline, Australia. We then compared catches before and after key weather events (such as floods) between 2006 and 2014 and used passive long-term acoustic telemetry to monitor movements of bull sharks into beach areas to test the model predictions. The CGLM showed that bull shark catch (occurrence) in beach areas is driven by rainfall and further influenced by sea surface temperature. Our model suggests that ≥100 mm total rainfall in the catchment associated with each beach area is significantly correlated with increased bull shark catch 1–8 days after the rainfall, a relationship also confirmed by the movements of acoustic tagged sharks between estuarine and beach areas. These trends provide the first predictive relationship for identifying increased risk of bull shark-human interactions in beach areas. They also suggest that the activity patterns of bull sharks are correlated with rainfall and this makes them particularly susceptible to localised, short-term changes in weather and long-term climate change.},

Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km3. The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.},

  journal = {PLOS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques have only recently been applied in the marine environment to detect the presence of marine species. Species-specific primers and probes were designed to detect the eDNA of the endangered Maugean skate (Zearaja maugeana) from as little as 1 L of water collected at depth (10–15 m) in Macquarie Harbour (MH), Tasmania. The identity of the eDNA was confirmed as Z. maugeana by sequencing the qPCR products and aligning these with the target sequence for a 100\% match. This result has validated the use of this eDNA technique for detecting a rare species, Z. maugeana, in the wild. Being able to investigate the presence, and possibly the abundance, of Z. maugeana in MH and Bathurst harbour (BH), would be addressing a conservation imperative for the endangered Z. maugeana. For future application of this technique in the field, the rate of decay was determined for Z. maugeana eDNA under ambient dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (55\% saturation) and lower DO (20\% saturation) levels, revealing that the eDNA can be detected for 4 and 16 hours respectively, after which eDNA concentration drops below the detection threshold of the assay. With the rate of decay being influenced by starting eDNA concentrations, it is recommended that samples be filtered as soon as possible after collection to minimize further loss of eDNA prior to and during sample processing.},

  journal = {Coral Reefs}, 
  abstract = {Remote monitoring technologies are increasingly being implemented in the marine environment to better understand the movement patterns of taxa. Coral reefs are no exception. However, there is a paucity of information relating to the performance of acoustic receivers on coral reefs. Our results suggest that the detection performance of acoustic receivers may be significantly impacted by the unique nature of the reef environment. This study assessed the performance of passive acoustic receivers on a typical inner-shelf fringing reef, Orpheus Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The detection range and diel performance variability of acoustic receivers was assessed using two parallel lines of 5 VR2W receivers spanning 125 m, deployed on the reef base and reef crest. Two 9-mm acoustic transmitters were moored at opposite ends of each receiver line. The working detection range for receivers was found to be approximately 90 m for the transmitter moored on the reef base and just 60 m for the transmitter moored on the reef crest. However, the detection range on the reef crest increased to 90 m when just the reef crest receivers were considered, highlighting importance of optimal receiver deployment. No diel patterns in receiver performance or detection capacities were detected, suggesting that no corrections are required when interpreting nocturnal versus diurnal activity patterns. We suggest that studies aiming for complete coverage of a site within a reef environment will require receivers in close (<100 m) proximity, and that the placement depth of receivers must be a major consideration, with shallow receivers exhibiting a greater detection range than those on the reef slope. Our results highlight the challenges imposed by coral reefs for acoustic telemetry and the importance of receiver placement for studies conducted within these habitats.},

  abstract = {For most of history, the ocean has remained nearly opaque to study, and it has been difficult to understand where salmon or other marine animals go or how they use the ocean. This greatly limits the ability of oceanographers and fisheries biologists to improve the management of many marine resources. The technical and scientific basis now exists to track the ocean movements of individual marine fish for months or years at a time. In this article, we review how new technologies might be applied to salmon in particular. Our conclusion is that animals as small as juvenile Pacific salmon can be followed for months to years at sea, and thus over great distances. By identifying the migration pathways for individual salmon and specific populations of Pacific salmon, we can establish their ocean foraging grounds. We outline the approaches and initial results from the Census of Marine Life program pacific ocean salmon tracking (POST). The research program involves two distinct aspects: (1) the development of an acoustic array for tracking the movements of Pacific salmon during their shelf-resident phase of the life history and (2) the use of archival (data storage) tags to measure aspects of their local environment and to delineate their open ocean migration pathways off the shelf. We report on some of the preliminary findings from the first year of the field project using acoustic tags.},

  abstract = {The mortality of salmon smolts during their migration out of freshwater and into the ocean has been difficult to measure. In the Columbia River, which has an extensive network of hydroelectric dams, the decline in abundance of adult salmon returning from the ocean since the late 1970s has been ascribed in large measure to the presence of the dams, although the completion of the hydropower system occurred at the same time as large-scale shifts in ocean climate, as measured by climate indices such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We measured the survival of salmon smolts during their migration to sea using elements of the large-scale acoustic telemetry system, the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) array. Survival measurements using acoustic tags were comparable to those obtained independently using the Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag system, which is operational at Columbia and Snake River dams. Because the technology underlying the POST array works in both freshwater and the ocean, it is therefore possible to extend the measurement of survival to large rivers lacking dams, such as the Fraser, and to also extend the measurement of survival to the lower Columbia River and estuary, where there are no dams. Of particular note, survival during the downstream migration of at least some endangered Columbia and Snake River Chinook and steelhead stocks appears to be as high or higher than that of the same species migrating out of the Fraser River in Canada, which lacks dams. Equally surprising, smolt survival during migration through the hydrosystem, when scaled by either the time or distance migrated, is higher than in the lower Columbia River and estuary where dams are absent. Our results raise important questions regarding the factors that are preventing the recovery of salmon stocks in the Columbia and the future health of stocks in the Fraser River.},

As animal-borne dataloggers capture a greater diversity and frequency of three dimensional movements, we can increase the complexity of movement models describing animal behavior. One challenge in combining data streams is the different spatial and temporal frequency of observations. Nested movement models provide a flexible framework for gleaning data from long-duration, but temporally sparse, data sources. Using a two-layer nested model, we combined geographic and vertical movement to infer traveling, foraging and resting behaviors of Humpback whales off the West Antarctic Peninsula. This approach refined previous work using only geographic data to delineate coarser behavioral states. Our results showed increased intensity in foraging activity in late season animals as the whales prepared to migrate north to tropical calving grounds. Our model also suggests strong diel variation in movement states, likely linked to daily changes in prey distribution. Using a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement data, we highlight the connection between whale movement and krill availability, as well as the complex spatial pattern of whale foraging in productive polar waters.},

  abstract = {Understanding animal distributions and habitat utilisation is vital for the management of populations, especially those of endangered species. However, this information is not available for the majority of marine species and is difficult to obtain for those with low population densities. The common skate, Dipturus batis, was once abundant and widespread in the North-East Atlantic but is now thought to be locally extinct in the Irish Sea and in the central and southern North Sea, and is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The constraints of skate body morphology on locomotory mode assume low levels of activity with long periods spent resting on the seabed, therefore predicting a high degree of site fidelity. To investigate this hypothesis we tagged 8 common skate (two male and six female, mass range: 10.9–63.5 kg) with depth and temperature-logging data storage tags off the west coast of Scotland in May 2008. All 6 tags attached to females were recovered after 1–9 months at liberty. All 6 individuals exhibited pronounced site fidelity to highly localised areas. Within these local areas however, time-depth profiles were dominated by periods of high activity, with vertical movements of >100 m being conducted on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. Intra-individual plasticity was observed in vertical activity patterns with individuals switching between low and high activity patterns. Smaller skate were generally less active and occupied deeper depths. Limited short-term horizontal movements in preferred habitats supporting apparently high foraging activity highlights the need for spatial management of ‘refugial’ populations of this once widespread fish, that appears now largely extirpated from European waters.},

Previous research from hunted narwhals indicated that narwhals in both populations depend on benthic prey to meet their dietary needs. To evaluate home ranges and define areas important for benthic foraging, we conducted kernel density analysis on narwhal locations and focused on areas where deep diving occurs, as a proxy for foraging, in the winter, spring, and migratory periods. These analyses revealed important areas for foraging for BB narwhals on the summer grounds in Eclipse Sound, and the winter grounds in Davis Strait, as well as on the migratory pathway between regions. Similarly, important areas were identified for the NHB narwhal population in northwestern Hudson Bay in summer, in NHB and Hudson Strait on the migration, and to the east of the entrance to Hudson Strait in the winter. This, along with an analysis of the absolute dive depths, provides information on seasons and regions important for foraging, which is particularly relevant with increasing industrial activities in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {Many elasmobranchs have experienced strong population declines, which have been largely attributed to the direct and indirect effects of exploitation. Recently, however, live elasmobranchs are being increasingly valued for their role in marine ecosystems, dive tourism and intrinsic worth. Thus, management plans have been implemented to slow and ultimately reverse negative trends, including shark-specific (e.g. anti-finning laws) to ecosystem-based (e.g. no-take marine reserves) strategies. Yet it is unclear how successful these measures are, or will be, given the degree of depletion and slow recovery potential of most elasmobranchs. Here, current understanding of elasmobranch population recoveries is reviewed. The potential and realized extent of population increases, including rates of increase, timelines and drivers are evaluated. Across 40 increasing populations, only 25\% were attributed to decreased anthropogenic mortality, while the majority was attributed to predation release. It is also shown that even low exploitation rates (2–6\% per year) can halt or reverse positive population trends in six populations currently managed under recovery plans. Management measures that help restore elasmobranch populations include enforcement or near-zero fishing mortality, protection of critical habitats, monitoring and education. These measures are highlighted in a case study from the south-eastern U.S.A., where some evidence of recovery is seen in Pristis pectinata, Galeocerdo cuvier and Sphyrna lewini populations. It is concluded that recovery of elasmobranchs is certainly possible but requires time and a combination of strong and dedicated management actions to be successful.},

A major shift in size composition and indices of species abundance and community biomass accompanied the start of fishing. The largest and most abundant predators, such as sharks and large tunas, suffered the greatest declines in abundance (21\% on average). They also showed striking reductions in mean body mass. For example, the mean mass of blue shark (Prionace glauca) was 52 kg in the 1950s compared to 22 kg in the 1990s. The estimated abundance of this species was 13\% of that in the 1950s. Overall, the biomass of large predators fell by a factor of 10 between the periods. By contrast, several small and formerly rare species increased in abundance, e.g., pelagic stingray (Dasyatis violacea). However, the increases in small species did not balance the reductions in the biomass of large predators. Of three possible explanations (fishing, environmental variation, and sampling bias), available evidence indicates fishing to be the most likely cause for the observed patterns.},

  journal = {Ecological Informatics}, 
  abstract = { Movement ecology has rapidly advanced owing to recent developments of animal-attached devices and wide applications of sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques in analysis of animal movement data. Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters used for estimating animal locations and tri-axial accelerometers used for measuring the 3-dimensional accelerations of animal's motion aid researchers in collecting location and locomotion data at fine spatial and temporal scales. Machine learning and other advanced statistical methods bridge conceptual models to data, providing insights into ecological and physiological mechanisms underlying animal behavior and movements. This study reviews the general principles and applications of state space models, hidden Markov models, random forests, and support vector machines in the inference of animal behavior from movement data. Unsupervised learning algorithms, including Bayesian state space models implemented for robust correlated random walk models and hidden Markov models, help infer different behavioral modes using GPS location data. State space models can account for measurement error in GPS locations and estimate the true locations of animals; however, without including movement-state switching, state space models do not infer behavioral modes directly. On the contrary, hidden Markov models estimate the probabilities that animals switch between different behavioral modes. Nevertheless, hidden Markov models neither directly estimate animal locations nor account for measurement error explicitly. Supervised learning algorithms integrate data on locations and directional accelerations with synchronized behavioral observations (i.e., labels) to classify behaviors to pre-defined behavioral categories. Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning requires behavioral observations to label locations and accelerometer data to train the learning algorithms. However, behavioral observations synchronized with relocations and acceleration records are often missing or unattainable in many species, hindering the applications of supervised learning, making unsupervised learning a suitable tool for behavioral annotation of movement paths in secretive (cryptic) or less studied species. Environmental and behavioral annotations of animal movement paths by machine learning improve understanding the effects of environmental conditions on animal movements and behavioral decisions.},

Area-under-the-curve was the highest for Florida panthers equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology compared to VHF technology. For our study animal, estimators of home range that incorporated a temporal component to estimation performed better than traditional first- and second-generation estimators. Comparisons of fit of home range contours with locations collected would suggest that use of VHF technology is not as accurate as GPS technology to estimate size of home range for large mammals. Estimators of home range collected with GPS technology performed better than those estimated with VHF technology regardless of estimator used. Furthermore, estimators that incorporate a temporal component (third-generation estimators) appeared to be the most reliable regardless of whether kernel-based or Brownian bridge-based algorithms were used and in comparison to first- and second-generation estimators. We defined third-generation estimators of home range as any estimator that incorporates time, space, animal-specific parameters, and habitat.

  abstract = {Temperature is the most important and least well documented environmental entity affecting reproduction and feeding of elasmobranch fishes, but it is unclear to what extent these fish may exploit behavioral thermoregulation to optimize physiological processes. Laboratory thermal preference determinations are important to understanding behavioral processes because they provide the vital quantitative link between environment, physiology, and adaptive behavior. Temperature preference data were collected on Atlantic stingrays, Dasyatis sabina (Lesueur) to assess the fishs’ ability to behaviorally optimize feeding and reproduction. Groups of male and pregnant female Atlantic stingrays exhibited statistically higher preferred median temperatures (26.2 and 26.1°C, respectively) than non-pregnant females (25.3°C; One-Way ANOVA on ranked data, F [2,26] = 3.72, p=0.038). Median preferred temperatures in unfed stingrays of both genders ranged from 24.5 to 31.0°C, whereas, fed fish preferred temperatures between 23.5 and 27.5°C. Unfed stingrays preferred a median temperature of 24.5°C; however, after feeding fish preferred significantly warmer water temperatures of 25.7°C (Wilcoxon one-tail, matched-pairs, signed rank analysis; p<0.088). While overall differences were subtle, small preference adjustments can have important physiological consequences. For example, the 1°C increase seen in pregnant females over non-pregnant fish would reduce gestation time by as much as two weeks. Likewise, by moving to cooler water after feeding, stingrays may increase nutrient uptake efficiency by reducing evacuation rates. Our data indicate that movement and distribution of Atlantic stingrays are dictated, in part, by temperature effects on physiology.},

  journal = {Journal of Animal Ecology}, 
  abstract = {Although growing evidence supports the idea that animal personality can explain plasticity in response to changes in the social environment, it remains to be tested whether it can explain spatial responses of individuals in the face of natural environmental fluctuations. This is a major challenge in ecology and evolution as spatial dynamics link individual‐ and population‐level processes. In this study, we investigated the potential of individual personalities to predict differences in fish behaviour in the wild. Specifically, our goal was to answer if individual differences in plasticity of space use to sea surface temperature could be explained by differences in personality along the reactive–proactive axis. To address this question, we first conducted repeated standard laboratory assays (i.e., open‐field test, novel object test and mirror stimulation test) to assess the personality type of 76 wild‐caught Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Next, we released the fish back into the sea and monitored their spatial behaviour over large temporal (16 months) and spatial (a whole fjord) scales, using high‐resolution acoustic tracking. We demonstrate that (a) cod personality traits are structured into a proactive–reactive syndrome (proactive fish being more bold, exploratory and aggressive), (b) mean depth use of individuals is mainly driven by sea temperature and (c) personality is a significant predictor of home range changes in the wild, where reactive, but not proactive, individuals reduced their home range as sea temperature increased. These findings expand our understanding of the ecological consequences of animal personality and the mechanisms shaping spatial dynamics of animals in nature. This study shows unprecedented links between animal personality measured in the laboratory and spatial ecology in wild fish. The authors show that reactive, but not proactive, Atlantic cod reduced their space use in the wild as sea temperature increased. This main finding contributes to our understanding of the ecological role of animal personality.},

These large-scale networks are now generating big data, allowing meta-analyses across multiple species, locations, and temporal scales. Broad-scale comparisons of animal movement metrics are constrained by the use of diverse analytical techniques among researchers. Accordingly, there is a need for a tool-set to assist in calculating animal movement metrics that can be easily applied to datasets from local studies to large-scale cooperative networks. We present a standardised framework and an associated analysis tool-set that facilitates the calculation of a range of activity space and movement metrics for passive telemetry datasets. Application of the tool-set is demonstrated using data from the Integrated Marine Observing System continental-scale network of underwater acoustic receivers. We show how the metrics can: (1) be directly compared among multiple species monitored at multiple sites; (2) be compared among multiple species tagged at a single study site; and (3) assess changes in activity space metrics over time. Establishing a framework and tool-set to analyse data from large-scale networks progresses the field of passive telemetry beyond the traditional individual-, species-, or location-centric approaches to facilitate national- or international-scale outputs that better address important questions in the field of movement ecology.},

This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved.},

Although there are benefits in maintaining a territory, there are also important costs, including energy expenditure and risk of injury. In most species, aggressive behaviors are highly regulated, and a variety of hormonal and neurobiological mechanisms have been identified. Recent studies have begun to outline how these mechanisms are affected by variation in the environment. In birds and rodents, different hormonal mechanisms regulate aggression in different seasons and photoperiod regimes. Modulation through social experience adds to this plasticity in aggression. In particular, previous experience winning aggressive encounters increases the probability of winning future encounters, regardless of intrinsic fighting ability. In males, this effect appears to be facilitated by testosterone, and there are hints that progesterone may be important in females. Since aggressive behavior does not occur in a vacuum, it is critical to consider how variations in the environment affect the mechanisms regulating aggression.},

Furthermore, the proportion of time individuals spent in the two different states and the state-switching frequency, differed between the sexes and between individuals. Predation attempts/success on pinnipeds were observed for sharks in both ARS and patrolling movement states and within all random effects groupings.

  abstract = {In the Life Sciences ‘omics’ data is increasingly generated by different high-throughput technologies. Often only the integration of these data allows uncovering biological insights that can be experimentally validated or mechanistically modelled, i.e. sophisticated computational approaches are required to extract the complex non-linear trends present in omics data. Classification techniques allow training a model based on variables (e.g. SNPs in genetic association studies) to separate different classes (e.g. healthy subjects versus patients). Random Forest (RF) is a versatile classification algorithm suited for the analysis of these large data sets. In the Life Sciences, RF is popular because RF classification models have a high-prediction accuracy and provide information on importance of variables for classification. For omics data, variables or conditional relations between variables are typically important for a subset of samples of the same class. For example: within a class of cancer patients certain SNP combinations may be important for a subset of patients that have a specific subtype of cancer, but not important for a different subset of patients. These conditional relationships can in principle be uncovered from the data with RF as these are implicitly taken into account by the algorithm during the creation of the classification model. This review details some of the to the best of our knowledge rarely or never used RF properties that allow maximizing the biological insights that can be extracted from complex omics data sets using RF.},

 a statistical analysis to reduce the effect of measurement errors. In this paper we
 present a novel technique for this analysis, one based on Hidden Markov Models

 dom walk. The HMM methodology produces, for each time step, the probability
 that the sh resides in each grid cell. Because there is no Monte Carlo step in our
 technique, we are able to estimate parameters within the likelihood framework. The
 method does not require the distribution to be Gaussian or belong to any other of the
 usual families of distributions and can thus address constraints from shorelines and
 other nonlinear effects; the method can and does produce bimodal distributions. We
 discuss merits and limitations of the method, and perspectives for the more general
 problem of inference in state-space models of animals. The technique can be applied
 to geolocation based on light, on tidal patterns, or measurement of other variables
 that vary with space. We illustrate the method through application to a simulated
 data set where geolocation relies on depth data exclusively.},

This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

This is especially true for highly mobile species, such as elasmobranchs, where the potential for spatial overlap of regional populations is increased as a result of greater movement capabilities. A lack of information on these processes means that management plans rarely consider spatio‐temporal structure. Spurdog (Squalus acanthias) are globally distributed throughout temperate regions yet there is an apparent lack of gene flow between ocean basins. In the North‐east Atlantic there is little work on gene flow within the region, which is currently managed as a single stock that is estimated to be at 19\% compared with 1905. Some evidence from this region suggests population processes that have the potential to cause structuring. The population structure of the North‐east Atlantic spurdog was investigated using an 828‐bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region and seven focal polymorphic microsatellite markers. Samples from 295 individuals from eight locations throughout UK waters were used in this study. Overall, mitochondrial sequences suggest some regional differentiation. Genetic diversity was comparable with that reported in previous studies of spurdog. Haplotype diversity (0.782–1.000) is amongst the highest observed for an elasmobranch. Microsatellite markers suggest that a high level of relatedness was responsible for regional population structuring. There was no apparent spatial structure after removal of ‘full sibling’ relationships. Inter‐haul variation from Celtic Sea samples is suggestive of subpopulations and aggregation events, which may have important implications for fisheries conservation of this and other elasmobranch species.},

An array of acoustic receivers in the Sacramento River and Delta, and the San Francisco Bay estuary detected the downstream movement of the steelhead. Two steelhead kelts (J and M) with archival tags were recovered at the hatchery after 219 and 285 days at liberty respectively. Based on changes in geolocations, vertical movements, and water temperatures, the migrations of steelhead J and M were divided into five and six phases respectively. Steelhead J moved into coastal California waters while steelhead M remained in freshwater for the majority of its time at liberty. Large increases in temperature and opacity were recorded before and after the ocean phases, likely as the steelhead moved through the Sacramento Delta. Both steelhead kelts remained relatively close to the surface throughout their migration but there were diurnal differences in the vertical movements. In freshwater, the steelhead tended to be deeper during the day (e.g., steelhead J: 3.08 ± 1.50 vs 1.65 ± 1.15 m, day vs night) but in the ocean, the steelhead were typically deeper during the night (1.32 ± 1.61 vs 5.63 ± 6.11 m). Both steelhead kelts appeared to be less oceanic than a previous study in Scott Creek, a small coastal stream approximately 100 km south of the mouth of San Francisco Bay. Although this study has a small sample size, the results suggest that steelhead kelts from a large river and estuary system, like the Sacramento River, may be relatively less oceanic than steelhead kelts from small coastal streams.},

Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or “PHRE”) that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {A review of past behavioral ultrasonic telemetry studies of sharks and rays is presented together with previously unpublished material on the behavior of the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, around the Bimini Islands, Bahamas. The review, focusing on movement behaviors of 20 shark and three ray species, reveals that elasmobranchs exhibit a variety of temporal and spatial patterns in terms of rates-of-movement and vertical as well as horizontal migrations. The lack of an apparent pattern in a few species is probably attributable to the scarcity of tracking data. Movements are probably governed by several factors, some still not studied, but data show that food, water temperature, bottom type, and magnetic gradient play major roles in a shark's decision of where and when to swim. A few species exhibit differences in behavior between groups of sharks within the same geographical area. This interesting finding warrants further research to evaluate the causes of these apparent differences and whether these groups constitute different subpopulations of the same species. The lack of telemetry data on batoids and some orders of sharks must be addressed before we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the behavior of elasmobranch fishes. Previously unpublished data from 47 smaller and 38 larger juvenile lemon sharks, collected over the decade 1988–1998, provide new results on movement patterns, habitat selection, activity rhythms, swimming speed, rate-of-movement, and homing behavior. From these results we conclude that the lemon shark is an active predator with a strong, apparently innate homing mechanism. This species shows ontogenetic differences in habitat selection and behavior, as well as differences in movements between groups of individuals within the same area. We suggest three hypotheses for future research on related topics that will help to understand the enigmatic behavior of sharks.},

  journal = {ICES Journal of Marine Science}, 
  abstract = {The impact of fishing on chondrichthyan stocks around the world is currently the focus of considerable international concern. Most chondrichthyan populations are of low productivity relative to teleost fishes, a consequence of their different life-history strategies. This is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of target shark fisheries. Most sharks and some batoids are predators at, or near, the top of marine food webs. The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50\% of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated from large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.},

An aerial survey data-based model of beluga density highlights the Beaufort Sea slope as important habitat for belugas, with westerly regions becoming more important as summer progresses into fall. The Barrow Canyon region always had the highest relative densities of belugas from July-October. Passive acoustic data showed that beluga whales occupied the Beaufort slope and Beaufort Sea from early April until early November and passed each hydrophone location in three broad pulses during this time. These pulses likely represent the migrations of the two beluga populations: the first pulse in spring being from Beaufort animals, the second spring pulse Chukchi belugas, with the third, fall pulse a combination of both populations. Core-use and home range analyses of satellite-tagged belugas showed similar use of habitats as the aerial survey data, but also showed that it is predominantly the Chukchi population of belugas that uses the western Beaufort, with the exception of September when both populations overlap. Finally, an examination of these beluga datasets in the context of wind-driven changes in the local currents and water masses suggests that belugas are highly capable of adapting to oceanographic changes that may drive the distribution of their prey.},

Most animals, and certainly all mammals, store information about places in cognitive maps—or neurally encoded representations of the geometric relations among places—and learn to associate objects or events with places on their map. I define the value of information as a time-dependent increment it adds to any appropriate currency of fitness for an informed versus an uninformed forager, and integrate it into simple conceptual models that help explain movements of animals that learn, forget, and use information. Unlike other space-use models, these recognize that movement decisions are based on an individual's imperfect and ever-changing expectancies about the environment—rather than omniscience or ignorance. Using simple, deterministic models, I demonstrate how the use of such dynamic information explains why animals use home ranges, and can help explain diverse movement patterns, including systematic patrolling or “traplining,” shifting activity or focal areas, extra-home-range exploration, and seemingly random (although goal-directed and spatially contagious) movements. These models also provide insights about interindividual spacing patterns, from exclusive home ranges (whether defended as territories or not) to broadly overlapping or shared ranges. Incorporating this dynamic view of animal expectancies and information value into more-complex and realistic movement models, such as random-walk, Bayesian foraging, and multi-individual movement models, should facilitate a more comprehensive and empirical understanding of animal space-use phenomena. The fitness value of cognitive maps and the selective exploitation of spatial information support a general theory of animal space use, which explains why mammals have home ranges and how they use them.},

  abstract = {The unusual energy metabolism of elasmobranchs is characterized by limited or absent fatty acid oxidation in cardiac and skeletal muscle and a great reliance on ketone bodies and amino acids as oxidative fuels in these tissues. Other extrahepatic tissues in elasmobranchs rely on ketone bodies and amino acids for aerobic energy production but, unlike muscle, also appear to possess a significant capacity to oxidize fatty acids. This organization of energy metabolism is reflected by relatively low plasma levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and by plasma levels of the ketone body ß-hydroxybutyrate that are as high as those seen in fasted mammals. The preference for ketone body oxidation rather than fatty acid oxidation in muscle of elasmobranchs under routine conditions is opposite to the situation in teleosts and mammals. Carbohydrates appear to be utilized as a fuel source in elasmobranchs, similar to other vertebrates. Amino acid- and lipid-fueled ketogenesis in the liver, the lipid storage site in elasmobranchs, sustains the demand for ketone bodies as oxidative fuels. The liver also appears to export NEFA and serves a buoyancy role. The regulation of energy metabolism in elasmobranchs and the effects of environmental factors remain poorly understood. The metabolic organization of elasmobranchs was likely present in the common ancestor of the Chondrichthyes ca. 400million years ago and, speculatively, it may reflect the ancestral metabolism of jawed vertebrates. We assess hypotheses for the evolution of the unusual energy metabolism of elasmobranchs and propose that the need to synthesize urea has influenced the utilization of ketone bodies and amino acids as oxidative fuels.},

  journal = {Journal of Animal Ecology}, 
  abstract = {Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton–zooplankton–vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food availability.2A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour.3In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent–dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent–dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator–prey interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus.4These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences.5The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold.},

  abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon among marine and freshwater organisms and many studies with various taxa have sought to understand its adaptive significance. Among crustacean zooplankton and juveniles of some fish species DVM is accepted widely as an antipredator behaviour, but little is known about its adaptive value for relatively large-bodied, adult predatory fish such as sharks. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on pelagic forms, which raises the question of whether DVM occurs in bottom-living predators.2To investigate DVM in benthic predatory fish in the marine environment and to determine why it might occur we tracked movements of adult male dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) by short- and long-term acoustic and archival telemetry. Movement studies were complemented with measurements of prey abundance and availability and thermal habitat within home ranges. A thermal choice experiment and energy budget modelling was used to investigate trade-offs between foraging and thermal habitat selection.3Male dogfish undertook normal DVM (nocturnal ascent) within relatively small home ranges (∼100 × 100 m) comprising along-bottom movements up submarine slopes from deeper, colder waters occupied during the day into warmer, shallow prey-rich areas above the thermocline at night. Few daytime vertical movements occurred. Levels of activity were higher during the night above the thermocline compared to below it during the day indicating they foraged in warm water and rested in colder depths.4A thermal choice experiment using environmentally realistic temperatures supported the field observation that dogfish positively avoided warmer water even when it was associated with greater food availability. Males in laboratory aquaria moved into warm water from a cooler refuge only to obtain food, and after food consumption they preferred to rest and digest in cooler water.5Modelling of energy budgets under different realistic thermal-choice scenarios indicated dogfish adopting a ‘hunt warm − rest cool’ strategy could lower daily energy costs by just over 4\%. Our results provide the first clear evidence that are consistent with the hypothesis that a benthic marine-fish predator utilizes DVM as an energy conservation strategy that increases bioenergetic efficiency.},

However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested6,7. Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal-attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators—sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins—exhibit Lévy-walk-like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum2. Prey density distributions also display Lévy-like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting Lévy-type foraging in natural-like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why Lévy-like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms3, from microbes8 to humans9, as a ‘rule’ that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions.},

  author = {Simpson, Samantha J. and Sims, David W.}, 
  journal = {Marine Policy}, 
  abstract = {Skates (Rajidae) have been commercially exploited in Europe for hundreds of years with some species’ abundances declining dramatically during the twentieth century. In 2009 it became “prohibited for EU vessels to target, retain, tranship or land” certain species in some ICES areas, including the critically endangered common skate and the endangered white skate. To examine compliance with skate bans the official UK landings data for 2011–2014 were analysed. Surprisingly, it was found that after the ban prohibited species were still reported landed in UK ports, including 9.6t of common skate during 2011–2014. The majority of reported landings of common and white skate were from northern UK waters and landed into northern UK ports. Although past landings could not be validated as being actual prohibited species, the landings’ patterns found reflect known abundance distributions that suggest actual landings were made, rather than sporadic occurrence across ports that would be evident if landings were solely due to systematic misidentification or data entry errors. Nevertheless, misreporting and data entry errors could not be discounted as factors contributing to the recorded landings of prohibited species. These findings raise questions about the efficacy of current systems to police skate landings to ensure prohibited species remain protected. By identifying UK ports with the highest apparent landings of prohibited species and those still landing species grouped as'skates and rays’, these results may aid authorities in allocating limited resources more effectively to reduce landings, misreporting and data errors of prohibited species, and increase species-specific landing compliance.},

Neonate and young-of-the-year animals occurred in the Caloosahatchee River and juveniles older than 1 year occurred in the adjacent embayments. Habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific predation risk and increase survival of young animals. Classification tree analysis showed that both temperature and salinity were important factors in determining the occurrence and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of immatureC. leucas. The CPUE of <1 year oldC. leucas was highest at temperatures over 29°C and in areas with salinities between 7‰ and 17.5‰ Although they are able to osmoregulate in salinities from fresh to fully marine, youngC. leucas may have a salinity preference. Reasons for this preference are unknown, but need to be further investigated.},

Sawfish were monitored within the study site from 1 to 473 days, and the number of consecutive days present ranged from 1 to 125. Residency index values for individuals varied considerably, with annual means highest in 2005 (0.95) and lowest in 2007 (0.73) when several P. pectinata moved upriver beyond detection range during drier conditions. Mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centers of activity was typically <0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 psu, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range. Thus, freshwater flow from Lake Okeechobee (and its effect on salinity) affects the location of individuals within the estuary, although it remains unclear whether or not these movements are threatening recovery.},

The method is equivalent to a short-term center of activity rather than a precise estimate of location at a single time. The utility of the method was assessed using data from a study of neonate blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Periods between 5 and 60 min were tested to find the most appropriate interval for estimating positions. The results from the method agreed closely with a simulated shark track and data from actively tracked sharks. The median distances between successive locations from the mean-position algorithm were between 28\% and 42\% of those from active tracking because of the center-of-activity nature of the method.

Modern tracking techniques such as active tracking and passive acoustic monitoring can be useful tools in elucidating this information for aquatic species. To aid in the development of conservation strategies for juvenile critically endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) their fine scale movements and habitat use in southwest Florida were studied using a combination of these techniques. Between 2002 and 2006 a total of 12 individuals were actively tracked for periods of up to 24h to provide detailed habitat use and movement parameters (distance moved, speed, and linearity). Smaller individuals (<100cm stretched total length (STL)) had the smallest home ranges, low linearity of movement and had a preference for very shallow mud banks. Juveniles >100cm STL demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud or and sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish <150cm STL spend the majority of their time in water <50cm, while larger juveniles spend most of their time in water 50–100cm deep. From 2003 to 2007 a total of 22 individuals were fitted with acoustic tags for long-term monitoring. Juveniles >130cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations. The use of a combination of tracking and monitoring techniques provided an expanded range of information by generating both short and long term data on habitat use. The data demonstrated that the conservation of shallow mud and sand banks, and mangrove shorelines will benefit the recovery of these endangered elasmobranchs.},

However, this biological and ecological research agenda will not be sufficient to fully secure conservation management. There is also a need for research to inform social and economic sustainability. Effective conservation management will be achieved by setting clear priorities for research with the aid of stakeholders, implementing well designed research projects, building the capacity for research, and clearly communicating the results to stakeholders.

Data from European eels (Anguilla anguilla) from Norwegian coastal waters were used to compare the information conveyed by 2D and 3D activity space estimates and the utility of this approach for aquatic species. The use of 3D kernels produced detailed representations of space use in A. anguilla that permitted examination of depth use in a geographic context. Comparison of 2D and 3D home ranges showed that 2D analyses overestimated the amount of overlap between individuals by 13\%–20\%, because individuals sometimes occurred in the same location but used different depths. Hence, the 3D approach provided more comprehensive representations of animal movement in three dimensions while producing a metric that can be used for testing hypotheses relating to scientific descriptions of activity space, habitat use, and movement parameters.},

On average, the code rejection coefficient was approximately 4\%, indicating that it was only a minor factor in reducing code detection efficiency. There were significant performance differences between stations and download periods, but no interaction between these two factors for all three metrics. Code detection efficiency, the rejection coefficient, and the noise quotient all showed significant variations with distance from the river mouth and time since deployment. Comparison of position estimates with and without efficiency produced small differences for bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) monitored via this system. Root mean square errors were higher for cownose rays (48m) than for bull sharks (23m). Mean differences for individuals were always slightly downstream because of the increasing code detection efficiency of upriver receivers. The results of this comparison indicated that the inclusion of code detection efficiency did not significantly improve the results of the positioning algorithm.},

The KF algorithm is reported to increase the number and accuracy of estimated positions over the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm, with potential advantages to the application of state-space methods to model animal movement data. We tested the performance of two Bayesian state-space models (SSMs) fitted to satellite tracking data processed with KF algorithm. Tracks from 7 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with ARGOS satellite transmitters equipped with Fastloc GPS loggers were used to calculate the error of locations estimated from SSMs fitted to KF and LS data, by comparing those to “true” GPS locations. Data on 6 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were used to investigate consistency in movement parameters, location and behavioural states estimated by switching state-space models (SSSM) fitted to data derived from KF and LS methods. The model fit to KF locations improved the accuracy of seal trips by 27\% over the LS model. 82\% of locations predicted from the KF model and 73\% of locations from the LS model were <5 km from the corresponding interpolated GPS position. Uncertainty in KF model estimates (5.6±5.6 km) was nearly half that of LS estimates (11.6±8.4 km). Accuracy of KF and LS modelled locations was sensitive to precision but not to observation frequency or temporal resolution of raw Argos data. On average, 88\% of whale locations estimated by KF models fell within the 95\% probability ellipse of paired locations from LS models. Precision of KF locations for whales was generally higher. Whales’ behavioural mode inferred by KF models matched the classification from LS models in 94\% of the cases. State-space models fit to KF data can improve spatial accuracy of location estimates over LS models and produce equally reliable behavioural estimates.},

  abstract = {Recent regulations have required European nations to report commercial landings of Rajidae (skates) to species level since 2008. Morphological similarities between some species, variability in colouration and regional differences in common names may compromise the accuracy of some of these data. An increased proportion of rajid landings reported by the U.K. (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) are now reported to species level (42\% in 2008, rising to 92\% in 2010). Recent landings (2007–2010) of Rajidae by the U.K. indicated that the majority of reported landings were made by otter trawl (55·9\%), tangle and gillnet (18·7\%) and beam trawl (15·5\%). Approximately 70\% of recent landings originated from four ICES Divisions: the Irish Sea (VIIa), western English Channel (VIIe), Bristol Channel (VIIf) and southern North Sea (IVc). Recent species-specific landings of Rajidae are appraised in terms of the species reported and the overall composition, and potential problems identified. Data from observer trips have been used to estimate the species composition of Rajidae taken in some of the main commercial fisheries operating around the British Isles, and these data are compared to landings. Although there was typically broad agreement between these data sets in terms of the main species landed, misidentification issues were apparent and Rajidae with highly patchy distributions may be under-represented in observer data. Data from observer trips were also used to examine the discard and retention pattern. Most rajid species were first retained from total lengths, LT, of 27–34 cm, with 50\% retention occurring at between 49 and 51 cm and near-full retention at LT of 60–67 cm. Beam trawls captured a higher proportion of smaller individuals, whilst gillnets (>150 mm mesh size) caught proportionally more larger rajids.},

  journal = {PLOS ONE}, 
  abstract = {The value of no-take marine reserves as fisheries-management tools is controversial, particularly in high-poverty areas where human populations depend heavily on fish as a source of protein. Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Spillover can contribute to poverty alleviation, although its effect is modulated by the number of fishermen and fishing intensity. In this study, we quantify the effects of a community-managed marine reserve in a high poverty area of Northern Mozambique. For this purpose, underwater visual censuses of reef fish were undertaken at three different times: 3 years before (2003), at the time of establishment (2006) and 6 years after the marine reserve establishment (2012). The survey locations were chosen inside, outside and on the border of the marine reserve. Benthic cover composition was quantified at the same sites in 2006 and 2012. After the reserve establishment, fish sizes were also estimated. Regression tree models show that the distance from the border and the time after reserve establishment were the variables with the strongest effect on fish abundance. The extent and direction of the spillover depends on trophic group and fish size. Poisson Generalized Linear Models show that, prior to the reserve establishment, the survey sites did not differ but, after 6 years, the abundance of all fish inside the reserve has increased and caused spillover of herbivorous fish. Spillover was detected 1km beyond the limit of the reserve for small herbivorous fishes. Six years after the establishment of a community-managed reserve, the fish assemblages have changed dramatically inside the reserve, and spillover is benefitting fish assemblages outside the reserve.},

  journal = {PLOS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Home range estimators are a critical component for understanding animal spatial ecology. The choice of home range estimator in spatial ecology studies can significantly influence management and conservation actions, as different methods lead to vastly different interpretations of movement patterns, habitat selection, as well as home range requirements. Reptile studies in particular have struggled to reach a consensus on the appropriate home range estimators to use, and species with cryptic behavior make home range assessment difficult. We applied dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) to radio-telemetry data from Ophiophagus hannah, a wide-ranging snake species. We used two focal individuals at different life stages (one juvenile male and one adult male) and sought to identify whether the method would accurately represent both their home range and movement patterns. To assess the suitability of dBBMMs, we compared this novel method with traditional home range estimation methods: minimum convex polygons (MCP) and Kernel density estimators (KDE). Both KDE and MCP incorporated higher levels of Type I and Type II errors, which would lead to biases in our understanding of this species space-use and habitat selection. Although these methods identified some general spatial-temporal patterns, dBBMMs were more efficient at detecting movement corridors and accurately representing long-term shelters sites, showing an improvement over methods traditionally favored in reptile studies. The additional flexibility of the dBBMM approach in providing insight into movement patterns can help further improve conservation and management actions. Additionally, our results suggest that dBBMMs may be more widely applicable in studies that rely on VHF telemetry and not limited to studies employing GPS tags.},

  abstract = {Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step‐selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat‐ and movement‐related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four‐step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models. New tracking technologies allow users to collect large amount of data and address entirely new questions.

  abstract = {Geolocation data were recovered from archival tags applied to bigeye tuna near Hawaii. A state-space Kalman filter statistical model was used to estimate geolocation errors, movement parameters, and most probable tracks from the recovered data. Standard deviation estimates ranged from 0.5° to 4.4° latitude and from 0.2° to 1.6° longitude. Bias estimates ranged from −1.9° to 4.1° latitude and from −0.5° to 3.0° longitude. Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3 nm day−1 for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000 nm2 day−1. Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates. The state-space Kalman filter model appears to provide realistic estimates of in situ geolocation errors and movement parameters, provides a means to avoid indeterminate latitude estimates during equinoxes, and is a potential bridge between analyses of individual and population movements.},

Diving only occurred during daylight hours, but dive depth was unrelated to light availability outside of the twilight periods. Dive durations (max = 90 s; mean = 54 s) were shorter and dive depths (max = 15 m; mean = 9 m) were shallower than recorded for guillemots elsewhere. The birds dived a maximum of 1.8 km from the colony.Conclusions Black Guillemots' dive duration was similar to the value predicted from allometry, and is therefore likely representative of this species.

Predators of forage fish may be influenced by this harvest, but the nature of these effects is contentious.

We used Bayesian inference to examine changes in chick survival, body condition and population growth rate of endangered African penguins Spheniscus demersus in response to 8 years of alternating time–area closures around two pairs of colonies. Our results demonstrate that fishing closures improved chick survival and condition, after controlling for changing prey availability. However, this effect was inconsistent across sites and years, highlighting the difficultly of assessing management interventions in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, modelled increases in population growth rates exceeded 1\% at one colony; i.e. the threshold considered biologically meaningful by fisheries management in South Africa. Fishing closures evidently can improve the population trend of a forage-fish-dependent predator—we therefore recommend they continue in South Africa and support their application elsewhere. However, detecting demographic gains for mobile marine predators from small no-take zones requires experimental time frames and scales that will often exceed those desired by decision makers.},

  abstract = {Climate change and fisheries are transforming the oceans, but we lack a complete understanding of their ecological impact [1–3]. Environmental degradation can cause maladaptive habitat selection, inducing ecological traps with profound consequences for biodiversity [4–6]. However, whether ecological traps operate in marine systems is unclear [7]. Large marine vertebrates may be vulnerable to ecological traps [6], but their broad-scale movements and complex life histories obscure the population-level consequences of habitat selection [8, 9]. We satellite tracked postnatal dispersal in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) from eight sites across their breeding range to test whether they have become ecologically trapped in the degraded Benguela ecosystem. Bayesian state-space and habitat models show that penguins traversed thousands of square kilometers to areas of low sea surface temperatures (14.5°C–17.5°C) and high chlorophyll-a (∼11 mg m−3). These were once reliable cues for prey-rich waters, but climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage fish stocks in this system [10, 11]. Juvenile penguin survival is low in populations selecting degraded areas, and Bayesian projection models suggest that breeding numbers are ∼50\% lower than if non-impacted habitats were used, revealing the extent and effect of a marine ecological trap for the first time. These cascading impacts of localized forage fish depletion—unobserved in studies on adults—were only elucidated via broad-scale movement and demographic data on juveniles. Our results support suspending fishing when prey biomass drops below critical thresholds [12, 13] and suggest that mitigation of marine ecological traps will require matching conservation action to the scale of ecological processes [14].},

The technology uses receivers to detect and record acoustic transmissions emitted from tags attached to an individual. Acoustic signal strength naturally attenuates over distance, but numerous environmental variables also affect the probability a tag is detected. Knowledge of receiver range is crucial for designing acoustic arrays and analyzing telemetry data. Here, we present a method for testing a relatively large-scale receiver array in a dynamic Caribbean coastal environment intended for long-term monitoring of multiple species. The U.S. Geological Survey and several academic institutions in collaboration with resource management at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), off the coast of St. Croix, recently deployed a 52 passive acoustic receiver array. We targeted 19 array-representative receivers for range-testing by submersing fixed delay interval range-testing tags at various distance intervals in each cardinal direction from a receiver for a minimum of an hour. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we estimated the probability of detection across the array and assessed the effect of water depth, habitat, wind, temperature, and time of day on the probability of detection. The predicted probability of detection across the entire array at 100 m distance from a receiver was 58.2\% (95\% CI: 44.0–73.0\%) and dropped to 26.0\% (95\% CI: 11.4–39.3\%) 200 m from a receiver indicating a somewhat constrained effective detection range. Detection probability varied across habitat classes with the greatest effective detection range occurring in homogenous sand substrate and the smallest in high rugosity reef. Predicted probability of detection across BIRNM highlights potential gaps in coverage using the current array as well as limitations of passive acoustic technology within a complex coral reef environment.},

  journal = {Journal of Sea Research}, 
  abstract = {Correspondence between patterns of occupied depth and environmental cycles, called “depth-specific periodic behavior”, has been used to inform management of several flatfishes. However, little is known about depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), an important species in recreational, commercial and subsistence fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. To evaluate depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut, an approach was developed in which depth data from electronic tags were used to produce four types of complementary plots, including two-dimensional time series of depth, activity level derived from differencing adjacent depth recordings, periodograms, and wavelet transform coefficients. From a visual examination of the plots, daily depth-specific periodic behavior types, including diel, tidal, spawning, semi-lunar and lunar, were assigned to 37 individual Pacific halibut. Overall, the approach used in this study was useful for describing relatively short term depth-specific periodic behavior, but was less informative for understanding relatively long term behavioral patterns. The results suggest that patterns in occupied depth may be related to seasonal activities of Pacific halibut. Specifically, during the summer feeding season, fish most commonly behaved periodically on a diel scale or inactively laid on the seafloor, which was manifested as tidal periodicity as the height of the water column fluctuated above the fish. Both active swimming and inactivity on the seafloor may be related to different foraging strategies. During fall and spring migratory periods and the winter spawning season, no periodicity in depth-specific behavior was most common, which may correspond to directed movement over irregular bathymetry between feeding and spawning locations or to reproductive behaviors. Evidence of an additional reproductive behavior, spawning rises off the seafloor, was also observed during the winter spawning season. This approach for understanding the periodicity of occupied depth of Pacific halibut provides additional insight into the behavior of this iconic species. This knowledge perhaps may be used in the future to inform this species' management, such as refining estimates of susceptibility to capture and examining timing of movement among regulatory areas.},

We conducted a global analysis of foraging areas of adult green turtles (Chelonia mydas) subject to satellite tracking (n= 145) and the conservation designation of these areas according to International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria.
Location  The green turtle has a largely circumtropical distribution, with adults migrating up to thousands of kilometres between nesting beaches and foraging areas, typically in neritic seagrass or algal beds.
Methods  We undertook an assessment of satellite tracking projects that followed the movements of green turtles in tropical and subtropical habitats. This approach was facilitated by the use of the Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (http://www.seaturtle.org) and the integration of publicly available data on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
Results  We show that turtles aggregate in designated MPAs far more than would be expected by chance when considered globally (35\% of all turtles were located within MPAs) or separately by ocean basin (Atlantic 67\%, Indian 34\%, Mediterranean 19\%, Pacific 16\%). Furthermore, we show that the size, level of protection and time of establishment of MPAs affects the likelihood of MPAs containing foraging turtles, highlighting the importance of large, well-established reserves.
Main conclusions  Our findings constitute compelling evidence of the world-wide effectiveness of extant MPAs in circumscribing important foraging habitats for a marine megavertebrate.},

Three turtles were tracked for a total of 73 days in May and June 2006, during which time 3753 GPS locations were obtained after filtering outliers (51 per day per turtle). The diving behaviour of these three turtles and three others was also monitored using time–depth recorders (TDR). The GPS data revealed that all three turtles spent most of their time in shallow water (< 4 m sea bed depth) very close to the shore (< 200 m), primarily ranging along an 18.5 km section of coastline. These observations were corroborated by TDR data acquired from all six turtles and frequent first-hand sightings of turtles close to shore during the breeding period. Comparison with random crawl movement models indicated that two of the tracked turtles moved with a similar non-random pattern, suggesting common biophysical processes might be driving their movements. The movement and depth data that we collected both suggest that existing legislation to safeguard sea turtles within this protected region may not include the most critical habitats for female loggerhead sea turtles during the breeding period. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using GPS tracking to investigate fine-scale movements of a marine vertebrate, illustrating the value of GPS tracking for wildlife conservation management.},

Research has shown fluctuations in the environment (abiotic factors) can trigger movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use for many elasmobranch species. Most studies to date have selectively focused on a small number of abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, salinity); however, other factors such as dissolved oxygen, tide, photoperiod, barometric pressure and pH have also been documented to act as drivers of movement in shark and ray species. Although usually examined individually, abiotic factors rarely act in isolation and often differ in their level of influence between species, sex, ontogenetic stage, season and geographic location. This paper reviews the role of abiotic factors as a driver of movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use in elasmobranchs. In the context of a changing climate, insight into how sharks and rays may respond to fluctuating environmental conditions projected under future scenarios is required.},

In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, Lévy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

  journal = {PeerJ}, 
  abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry using coded transmitter tags and stationary receivers is a popular method for tracking movements of aquatic animals. Understanding the performance of these systems is important in array design and in analysis. Close proximity detection interference (CPDI) is a condition where receivers fail to reliably detect tag transmissions. CPDI generally occurs when the tag and receiver are near one another in acoustically reverberant settings. Here we confirm transmission multipaths reflected off the environment arriving at a receiver with sufficient delay relative to the direct signal cause CPDI. We propose a ray-propagation based model to estimate the arrival of energy via multipaths to predict CPDI occurrence, and we show how deeper deployments are particularly susceptible. A series of experiments were designed to develop and validate our model. Deep (300 m) and shallow (25 m) ranging experiments were conducted using Vemco V13 acoustic tags and VR2-W receivers. Probabilistic modeling of hourly detections was used to estimate the average distance a tag could be detected. A mechanistic model for predicting the arrival time of multipaths was developed using parameters from these experiments to calculate the direct and multipath path lengths. This model was retroactively applied to the previous ranging experiments to validate CPDI observations. Two additional experiments were designed to validate predictions of CPDI with respect to combinations of deployment depth and distance. Playback of recorded tags in a tank environment was used to confirm multipaths arriving after the receiver’s blanking interval cause CPDI effects. Analysis of empirical data estimated the average maximum detection radius (AMDR), the farthest distance at which 95\% of tag transmissions went undetected by receivers, was between 840 and 846 m for the deep ranging experiment across all factor permutations. From these results, CPDI was estimated within a 276.5 m radius of the receiver. These empirical estimations were consistent with mechanistic model predictions. CPDI affected detection at distances closer than 259–326 m from receivers. AMDR determined from the shallow ranging experiment was between 278 and 290 m with CPDI neither predicted nor observed. Results of validation experiments were consistent with mechanistic model predictions. Finally, we were able to predict detection/nondetection with 95.7\% accuracy using the mechanistic model’s criterion when simulating transmissions with and without multipaths. Close proximity detection interference results from combinations of depth and distance that produce reflected signals arriving after a receiver’s blanking interval has ended. Deployment scenarios resulting in CPDI can be predicted with the proposed mechanistic model. For deeper deployments, sea-surface reflections can produce CPDI conditions, resulting in transmission rejection, regardless of the reflective properties of the seafloor.},

  abstract = {The skeleton of the “wings” of skates and rays consists of a series of radially oriented cartilaginous fin rays emanating from a modified pectoral girdle. Each fin ray consists of small, laterally oriented skeletal elements, radials, traditionally represented as simple cylindrical building blocks. High-resolution radiography reveals the pattern of calcification in batoid wing elements, and their organization within the fin ray, to be considerably more complex and phylogenetically variable than previously thought. Calcification patterns of radials varied between families, as well as within individual pectoral fins. Oscillatory swimmers show structural interconnections between fin rays in central areas of the wing. Morphological variation was strongly predictive of locomotor strategy, which we attribute to oscillatory swimmers needing different areas of the wing stiffened than do undulatory swimmers. Contributions of various forms of calcification to radial stiffness were calculated theoretically. Results indicate that radials completely covered by mineralized tissue (“crustal calcification”) were stiffer than those that were calcified in chain-like patterns (“catenated calcification”). Mapping this functionally important variation onto a phylogeny reveals a more complicated pattern than the literature suggests for the evolution of locomotor mode. Therefore, further investigation into the phylogenetic distribution of swimming mode is warranted. J. Morphol. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The Common Fisheries Policy plan proposed by the European Commission for 2014–2020 presents a controversial goal: to enforce the landing of fishing discards as a measure to encourage their reduction. This historical and political decision will shape the future of the fishing exploitation in European Seas. Discards generated by European fleets are not negligible, and its reduction is an ecological, socioeconomical and moral imperative. However, it must be achieved through the reduction in discards at source and the promotion of selective and non-destructive gears. We argue it is doubtful that this discard ban will result in an effective reduction of discards. The proposed measure may, in fact, negatively affect ecosystems at all levels of biological hierarchy by disregarding the Ecosystem-Based Approach to Fisheries and the Precautionary Principle. It could negatively impact several species by increasing fishing mortality, also commercial species if discards are not accounted in the total allowable catch. Communities preying on discards will likely be affected. The role discards currently play in the energy turnover of current ecosystems will be modified and should be fully evaluated. The landing of discards will likely generate new markets of fishmeal due to the growing demands for marine living resources. The ban will require substantial public investment to deal with technical problems on board and to control and enforce.

Experiments at temperatures similar to those experienced in nature revealed temperature change had no significant effect on C. plagiosum absorption or evacuation rates, suggesting stenothermic sharks cannot exploit temperature differences as a means to improve digestion efficiency.

The relative decrease was greater for evacuation (Q10 = 3·08) than absorption rates (Q10 = 2·20), resulting in a significant increase in total absorption, suggesting D. sabina can benefit from using shuttling behaviour to exploit thermal variability in their environment to maximize energetic uptake.},

  journal = {Fisheries Research}, 
  abstract = {Trawls harness the innate avoidance behavior of fish to affect their capture. As such, effective bycatch reduction relies, in part, upon knowledge of behavioral differences between target and non-target species. The behavior of flatfish during herding, net entry and passage through trawls differs substantially from that of many roundfish. These differences result from the unique body morphology of flatfish and the constraints this morphology places upon their natural predator avoidance and evasion tactics. Paramount, in this regard, is the intimate association between flatfish and the seafloor. Flatfish utilize a detection minimization strategy that combines burial, highly evolved cryptic capabilities and low activity. Additionally, the maximum sustained swimming speeds and endurance of flatfishes are low compared to most roundfish. As a result, flatfish typically respond to trawl ground-gear at shorter distances, remain closer to the seafloor during herding and herd in the net mouth for a shorter time, prior to net entry, than roundfish. As is the case for roundfish species, light and temperature influence flatfish reactivity and herding behavior. At low ambient light levels herding behavior in flatfish breaks down, as fish initially respond to ground-gear by rising off the bottom, which removes them from the ground-gear's zone of influence. Similarly, at low temperatures some flatfish display reduced herding. Differences in behavior between flatfish and roundfish have spurred development of selective flatfish trawls, with low rise head ropes and/or open or large mesh intermediates that allow rising roundfish to exit the net opening, while flatfish remain close to the net floor, passing into the net and back to the codend. Lastly, a conceptual design for a counter-herding device is presented, which takes advantage of the longer reactive distances of roundfish, and their tendency to herd farther of the seafloor, thereby allowing them to be herded out of the path of the net, while not influencing the normal inward herding of flatfish.},

A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25 km from the piling activity; within 25 km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83\% (95\% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178 dB re 1 μPa(p-p). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2 h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.},

  abstract = {Investigation of activity budgets in relation to seasonal, intrinsic (age, sex) and extrinsic (time of day, spatial) covariates enables an understanding of how such covariates shape behavioural strategies. However, conducting such investigations in the wild is challenging, because of the required large sample size of individuals across the annual cycle, and difficulties in categorising behavioural states and analysing the resulting individual-referenced and serially correlated data. In this study, from telemetry tags deployed on 63 grey seals Halichoerus grypus and 126 harbour seals Phoca vitulina we used behavioural data, and movement data within a Bayesian state–space model (SSM), to define population-level activity budgets around Britain. Using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) we then examined how time spent in four states (resting on land (hauled out), resting at sea, foraging and travelling) was influenced by seasonal, intrinsic and extrinsic covariates. We present and discuss the following key findings. 1) We found no evidence that regional variation in foraging effort was linked to regional population trajectories in harbour seals. 2) Grey seals demonstrated sex-specific seasonal differences in their activity budgets, independent from those related to reproductive costs. 3) In these sympatric species there was evidence of temporal separation in time hauled out, but not in time foraging. 4) In both species, time spent resting at sea was separated into inshore (associated with tidal haul out availability) and offshore areas. Time spent resting at sea and on land was interchangeable to some extent, suggesting a degree of overlap in their functionality. This may result in a relaxation of the constraints associated with a central place foraging strategy. More generally, we demonstrate how a large dataset, incorporating differing tag parameters, can be analysed to define activity budgets and subsequently address important ecological questions.},

Conserving such mobile species is challenging; the effectiveness of a conservation action taken at one site depends on the condition of other sites that may be geographically and politically distant (thousands of kilometers away or in another jurisdiction, for example). Recent work has shown that even simple and predictable linkages among sites caused by “to-and-fro” migration can make migratory species especially vulnerable to habitat loss, and substantially affect the results of conservation prioritizations. Species characterized by more erratic or nomadic movements are very difficult to protect through current conservation planning techniques, which typically view species distributions as static. However, collaborations between migration ecologists, conservation planners, and mathematical ecologists are paving the way for improvements in conservation planning for mobile species.},

  abstract = {In previous chapters we considered various models of encounter probability, both in terms of parametric functions of distance and types of covariate models. However, we have so far only considered a specific probability model for the observations (we’ll call this the “observation model”)—the Bernoulli encounter process model, which in secr is the proximity detector model. This assumes that individual and trap-specific encounters are independent Bernoulli trials. In this chapter, we focus on developing additional observation models. The observation model could be thought of as being determined by the type of device—or, in secr terminology, the type of “detector.” We consider models that apply when observations are not binary and, in some cases, that do not require independence of the observations. For example, if sampling devices can detect an individual some arbitrary number of times during an interval, then it is natural to consider observation models for encounter frequencies, such as the Poisson model. Another type of encounter device is the “multi-catch” device, which is a physical device that can capture and hold an arbitrary number of individuals. A typical example is a mist-net for birds. It is natural to regard observations from these kinds of studies as independent multinomial observations. A related group of devices that produces dependent multinomial observations are the so-called single-catch traps. The canonical examples are small-mammal live traps which catch and hold a single individual. Competition among individuals for traps induces a complex dependence structure among individual encounters. To date, no formal inference framework has been devised for this method although the independent multinomial model can be a good approximation. The final sampling method covered in this chapter involves acoustic recording devices, and we explain how to analyze the resulting data. Throughout, several worked examples are presented using JAGS and secr.},

  abstract = {In search-encounter surveys, space is not sampled using fixed devices such as camera traps, but instead, space is actively searched, for example along randomly placed linear transects, or by systematically searching a plot. Such surveys allow us to observe individual locations independent of detector locations, thus allowing us to separate the animal movement component from the observation-by-distance component of the observation process. For searches along fixed search paths, the probability of detecting an individual will depend on some distance metric between the animal’s location during sampling and the search path. Because detections do not occur at a point but along a line, the detection model has to describe the total encounter probability induced by the line, also referred to as the ”total hazard to encounter”. Separately from the detection model, we need a model that describes the locations of individuals as movement outcomes, for example, conditional on their activity centers. Other variations of this design, such as unstructured sampling where survey paths have not been defined a priori, are briefly discussed. A second common design is that of uniform search intensity over some quadrat. In that case, the probability of encounter of an individual is constant if the individual is within the polygon during sampling. For both design types, we present how to simulate and analyze data and present some example analyses. Additionally, we discuss some alternative individual movement models and discuss some consideration of how to analyze search-encounter designs with partial information, for example, when the search path was not recorded. Considering the constant improvement of noninvasive genetic sampling techniques, the importance of search-encounter methods for population monitoring is bound to increase.},

First, we provide an introduction to the ordinary (non-spatial) Jolly-Seber (JS) model, which estimates both abundance and demographic rates. We address how to carry out Bayesian analysis of this model using a data augmentation framework, as well as a few of the technical issues related to this formulation of the model. Using data augmentation, it is easy to provide an individual capture-history formulation of the model, and this facilitates the inclusion of individual covariates. Based on this individual capture-history formulation of the model, it is straight forward to extend the non-spatial to a spatial JS model.We reanalyze the ovenbird mist-netting data from Efford et al. (2004), which we previously analyzed using the multi-session modeling framework, using a spatial Jolly-Seber type of model. We further discuss the classical Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model, which is a restricted version of the JS model that conditions on entry into the sample, and therefore does not model the recruitment process. We provide an example of modeling movement and survival using a spatial CJS model fitted to data from a study of American shad in spawning migration. Finally, we discuss other types of spatial capture-recapture models that involve more complex movement dynamics such as dispersal, encorporating, for example, a model for how individual activity centers move throughout time.},

In this chapter we present an alternative to using Euclidean distance to measure the distance from traps to individual activity centers. After discussing the shortcomings of Euclidean distance models, we present an alternative approach based on a cost-weighted distance metric, and the least-cost path between an individual’s activity center and a trap location. Examples of how to calculate cost-weighted distances are provided as well as how to simulate SCR data and fit models based on “ecological distance.” We also provide a likelihood analysis based on the ecological distance models. Being able to conduct such analyses requires knowledge of how to do basic geographic analysis in R, which we show specifically how to do. This functionality is also useful for calculating distances in an irregular patch, such as would be applicable to corridor and reserve design analyses. Parameterizing SCR models in terms of one or more parameters that relate the resistance of the landscape to explicit covariates allows us to explicitly accommodate landscape structure and account for connectivity of the landscape simultaneous with modeling test of density.},

Such stratified populations are commonplace in capture-recaptures studies, especially in the context where the strata represent distinct spatial regions. A standard example that arises frequently is that in which multiple habitat patches (often refuges, parks or reserves) are sampled independently with the goal of estimating the population size of some focal species in each reserve, or modeling the effect of explicit covariates related to landscape structure or management regime.We present a Bayesian framework for inference for stratified SCR models using data augmentation, and also demonstrate the use of multi-session models in the R package secr. We apply the stratified models to the ovenbird data, in which the strata are not spatially indexed but, instead, represent temporally defined strata (years). For such cases, we imagine a fully dynamic, or demographically open model might be appropriate—one that involves survival and recruitment (covered in Chapter 16). However, the stratified SCR models can be thought of as a primitive type of model for open systems in which the population sizes are assumed to be independent, and so we might still find them useful as simplified models for open populations.},

  abstract = {All SCR models described in previous chapters address the classical situation (of all capture-recapture studies) in which individuals in the population can be uniquely identified when captured. This is not always possible using common methods of sampling. In this chapter, we investigate spatially explicit alternatives for estimating density of unmarked populations. That is, when individual identity is not possible or not available. We develop a framework for inference in these cases by specifying a model for observed trap-specific counts that is conditional on an underlying SCR model. The encounter histories are completely latent and the observed counts are aggregations of the latent encounter histories. Because the model is formulated in terms of the data we wish we had, i.e., the typical encounter history data observed in standard capture-recapture studies of marked animals, the model for counts is just a SCR model with a single extension to account for the fact that the encounter history data are unobserved. Using the methods in this chapter, we find that SCR models can be applied to data collected using methods like points counts in which observers record simple counts of animals at an array of survey locations. The model can also be fitted to camera trapping data collected on unmarked animals, representing one of the first formal method for estimating density from such data. To demonstrate the model, we begin by applying it in its most basic form to simulated data. Then we proceed, by way of a few examples, to consider extensions of the model in which ancillary information can be used to increase precision. Extensions of the method to improve precision include obtaining informative priors based on information from the literature, or using a subsample of marked individuals (covered in detail in Chapter 19). The method can also be extended to include other sampling protocols or model structures, and we provide an application to sampling salamanders along a stream which involves a removal type of sampling protocol. The model for the salamander data also includes a spatially explicit submodel for temporary emigration, allowing for movement-induced correlation in the count data from neighboring stream segments.},

Since spatial capture-recapture models are a variation of GLMMs, in this chapter we explore the analysis of simple GL(M)Ms in a Bayesian framework. While most of these models are readily analyzed with classical frequentist/likelihood methods, Bayesian analysis allows us to make direct probabilistic statements about parameters and does not rely on statements of asymptotic behavior. We demonstrate the straight-forward implementation of a linear mixed model in the BUGS language, the language used by the programs WinBUGS and JAGS. We introduce practical issues of Bayesian analysis, such as choice of prior probability distributions for model parameters and diagnostics to evaluate the model results. With this background established we move on to implementing Poisson and binomial GL(M)Ms. We rely predominantly on the BUGS language, but we also briefly introduce the reader to writing custom algorithms to analyze GL(M)Ms in a Bayesian framework directly in R. We finish the chapter with a brief introduction to goodness-of-fit tests and model choice. Although these issues are controversial, we show some straight-forward approaches to dealing with them in a Bayesian framework.

These models are referred to as “inhomogeneous point process” (or IPP) models. To analyze SCR data using an IPP model in continuous space we provide a custom MCMC algorithm in the accompanying R package scrbook. Discrete space IPP models can be implemented in the BUGS language, or in the R package secr. Moreover, we can combine IPP models with models using ecological distance (i.e., distance as perceived by the organism under study, which for example might be related to habitat structure) instead of Eucledian distance (see Chapter 12). This makes it possible to simultaneously estimate parameters describing the effect of habitat on density and on animal movement from simple SCR data. We apply the IPP model to a camera trap data set of jaguars from Argentina, using the degree of protection from poaching as a density covariate.},

  abstract = {Throughout most of this book we have dealt with the situation where all individuals in the population are uniquely identifiable. In Chapter 18 we introduced and developed an SCR model for non-identifiable individuals. These two extremes are common in the study of animal populations with non-invasive sampling methods. However, there is also an intermediate situation where part of the population is tagged or otherwise marked, while some individuals are unidentifiable. So-called mark-resight models can be used to estimate population size and density by combining data from both the marked and unmarked individuals. In mark-resight studies a sample of individuals is captured and marked during a single marking event. Marking is followed by resighting surveys, in which both the detection of marked and unmarked animals is recorded. In this chapter we consider mark-resight within a spatial context and develop a spatial mark-resight (SMR) model. We first provide some background information on (non-spatial) mark-resight and the types of data such surveys can provide. The main distinctions hinge on whether or not we know the number of marked individuals, and whether we can correctly determine if an individual is marked or not. An essential assumption of mark-resight models is that the marked individuals are a representative sample of the study population. While this is also an implicit assumption of capture-recapture models, in mark-resight models this means that the process of marking individuals requires careful consideration in order to produce a random sample. In the context of SMR models, this assumption refers not only to the demographic composition, but also to the spatial distribution of the marked individuals in the state-space S. Throughout the central part of this chapter we will make the assumption that marked animals are a random sample from the population in S. We explore models for both known and unknown numbers of marked individuals, and for imperfect individual identification of marks, and approaches to incorporate telemetry location data. We present 2 applications: First, we apply the models with unknown number of marked individuals to a study of Canada geese from North Carolina. Second, we give an example involving radio telemetry applied to a study of racoons on the Outer Banks. We conclude the chapter by presenting some general strategies for addressing a situation where marked individuals are not a random spatial sample from the state-space. We expect that real life studies rarely meet this assumption, and the effect of this violation, as well as the development of models that relax the assumption, needs to be the focus of future work.},

If population size (N) is known, these models resemble simple logistic regressions, where the observations (0 = not captured or 1 = captured on each occasion) are Bernoulli trials with detection probability p. Usually, though, we are interested in estimating N, and we can do so using data augmentation, which involves adding a large number of all-zero encounter histories to the n observed encounter histories, and estimating how many of these hypothetical individuals are part of the population but were never observed. This reformulation of the capture-recapture model facilitates Bayesian analysis and the inclusion of individual covariates, and thus we use data augmentation frequently throughout the rest of the book. To demonstrate data augmentation, we present examples and BUGS code for non-spatial capture-recapture models incorporating different sources of variation in p. The drawback of non-spatial estimates of abundance is that they are not linked to a specific area and so ad hoc approaches are necessary to define an area in order to estimate density. We present some common approaches to do so and discuss their shortcomings. We show that individual covariate models, where the covariate is some description of an animal’s location in space, such as average capture location, are a step towards fully spatial capture-recapture models. The last section of this chapter highlights the parallels of distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture.

  abstract = {In the context of spatial sampling problems, where populations of mobile animals are sampled by an array of traps (or other sampling devices), there are a number of critical design elements. Two of the most important ones are the spacing and configuration of traps within the array. In this chapter we recommend a general framework for evaluating design choices for SCR studies, such as trap spacing, using Monte Carlo simulation of specific design scenarios—what we call scenario analysis. We evaluate trade-offs between trap spacing and the total area covered by traps (considerations that are related to available funding and logistics), including designs based on regular, clustered and rotating traps, and show that SCR models are flexible and perform well under a range of spatial design scenarios. While we recommend scenario analysis as a general tool to understand your expected data before carrying out a spatial capture-recapture study, it is possible to develop some heuristics and even analytic results related to the broader problem of model-based spatial design using an explicit objective function based on the inference objective. We outline an approach where we identify a variance criterion, namely, the variance of an estimator of N for the prescribed state-space. An ideal spatial design should minimize this variance. We show that this depends on the configuration of trap locations, and we provide a framework for optimizing the variance criterion over the design space (the collection of all possible designs of a given size).},

We discuss the future of spatial capture-recapture models in ecological research and suggest that they will increase in importance and largely replace non-spatial capture-recapture models. This prediction stems from the fact that, although we have demonstrated many potential uses for SCR models, many more await to be developed. For instance, we foresee models to describe and predict the consequences of individual interactions, such as competition and territoriality. Another exciting extension is to embed explicit movement models into SCR models for inference about movement behavior, and to improve the description of the observation process. SCR models are also lagging behind non-spatial models in some important ways. For instance, at the time of this writing, no one has devised methods for accomodating misidentification, and very few methods exist for combining different sources of data. Other important extensions that we briefly cover include models for gregarious species and models for single-catch traps. Each of these extensions should be achievable, and headway has already been made in some cases. We hope this book will inspire more rapid progress, and motivate new ideas and perspectives that will ultimately increase the usefulness of SCR models for addressing important problems in ecology and conservation.},

Most models, such as the Gaussian kernel that we have used in a number of examples, include a parameter that acts as a baseline encounter probability, and a scale parameter determining how rapidly encounter probability declines with distance. We present models for encounter probability that depend on different kinds of covariates, which may vary by individual, by trap, or over time. Both the baseline encounter probability and the scale parameter can be modeled as functions of these covariates. Covariates may be fully observed (e.g., trap specific covariates), partially observed (e.g., sex), or unobserved (e.g., individual heterogeniety). Each of these types of covariates can be easily modeled in WinBUGS or JAGS, and for demonstration, we continue with the analysis of the black bear data introduced in Chapter 4.

  abstract = {Capture-recapture methods represent perhaps the most common technique for studying animal populations, and their use is growing in popularity due to recent technological advances that provide methods to study many taxa which before could not be studied efficiently, if at all. These advances include, but are not limited to, camera trapping, DNA sampling, acoustic sampling, and search-encounter methods. In this chapter, we review the basics of traditional capture recapture modeling and present a case study on black bear data collected at Fort Drum, NY. These data are analyzed using traditional capture-recapture methods to demonstrate the modeling approach and to highlight the issues related to calculating the effective trapping area. In traditional capture-recapture models, abundance (N) is estimated; however, researchers are often interested in density and thus an area must be associated with the estimate of abundance. Animals move in space and time, and thus their exposure to trapping is variable, rending the effective trapping area a complicated issue when space is not incorporated directly into the model. We discuss previous work to address this issue including buffering the trapping array, using an approach related to modeling temporary emigration, and considering the average location as an individual covariate. However, none of the approaches have proved to be satisfactory and this led to the development of spatial capture recapture (SCR) models, which incorporate space explicitly and allow individuals to have variable exposure to trapping based generally on where they live and how much they move. In this chapter, we also introduce the fundamental concepts behind SCR models including the formulation of animal activity centers as a point process, the state-space, and estimation of abundance and density.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on two basic inference tasks: model selection (which model or models should be favored), and model assessment (do the data appear to be consistent with a particular model). Researchers commonly want to compare competing models to determine “the best” model for their data. For example, this might include comparisons of models with and without a behavior response or models with and without time-dependent encounter rates. To assist readers in making such comparisons, we review some basic strategies of model selection using both likelihood methods (as implemented in the the R package secr) and Bayesian analysis. Specifically, we review a number of methods for “variable selection” problems, when our set of models consists of distinct covariate effects and they represent constraints of some larger model. For classical analysis based on likelihood, model selection by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the standard approach. For Bayesian analysis there are a number of different methods—we cover the use of the deviance information criterion (DIC), the Kuo and Mallick indicator variable selection approach, and for model adequacy, we cover the Bayesian p-value method for assessing goodness-of-fit. We also discuss sensitivity to state space resolution and extent and how to quantify lack-of-fit. As a demonstration of the various approaches that are outlined, we work with data from the wolverine camera trapping study to investigate sex specificity of model parameters and whether there is a behavioral response to encounter. We evaluate whether certain models for encounter probability appear to be adequate descriptions of the data, and we evaluate the uniformity assumption for the underlying point process.},

We list the basic assumptions of SCR models and we provide some basic tools for simulating and analyzing spatial capture-recapture data in R, so that the assumptions and properties of the model can be fully appreciated.

This technique generates lagrangian data of a particular type in marine ecology: although highly informative about processes at different scales (e.g. horizontal movements versus diving behaviour), such data are impaired by location errors and the lack of combination with actual environmental variability. The present paper introduces a framework for modelling bluefin tuna movement in relation to its habitat, using records of light, depth and temperature from archival tags. Based on data assimilation concepts and methods, we show how an explicit formulation of the observation process and the statistics of external variables (e.g. ambient temperature) can improve precision in geolocation. The proposed method is tested on synthetic data: significant reduction (40 to 50\%) in the initial root-mean square error is achieved under different noise scenarios. Assimilating sea surface temperature also allows to perform on-line estimation of a range of observation biases. The performance of the model greatly benefits from the adequate formalisation of different variability sources, and allows potentially to reveal interactions between the fish and its habitat. Using this probabilistic approach, we, however, show that some patterns of interest (e.g. foraging in surface fronts) can hardly be retrieved in a context of large observational and environmental noise.},

In other words, scientists can examine wild animals in the field, behaving normally, with the same rigor that is normally used in the laboratory. The flexibility of such recording systems means that bio-logging science operates at the interface of several biological disciplines, looking at a wide array of aquatic, airborne, and terrestrial species, monitoring not only the physical characteristics of the environment, but also the animal's reactions to it.

Take reduction plans have been largely successful in reducing direct fisheries bycatch, although they have not been prepared for all at-risk stocks, and fisheries continue to place marine mammals as risk.

  author = {Rogers‐Bennett, Laura and Haaker, Peter L. and Karpov, Konstantin A. and Kushner, David J.}, 
  journal = {Conservation Biology}, 
  abstract = {Abalone populations have declined dramatically in southern California. The white abalone (   Haliotis sorenseni) is now (  2001) on the federal endangered species list. To aid in the restoration of white, pink (  H. corrugata), and green abalone (  H. fulgens), productive marine protected areas need to be selected. We used spatially explicit fishery data (1950–1995) to identify the most productive marine areas in southern California. To assess the role of existing marine protected areas we compared fishery-independent data (1983–2001) inside protected and fished areas. San Clemente Island produced the greatest cumulative catches of white, pink, and green abalone, the most white abalone per hectare of deep reef (25–65 m), and the most green abalone per kilometer of rocky shoreline. Santa Barbara Island, however, produced 10 times more pink abalone per hectare of kelp canopy, making this area an excellent candidate for restoration and protection. Pink abalone surveyed in the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program were most abundant at three sites surrounding Anacapa Island: (1) protected, (2) protected but less visible, and (3) fished. The protected sites, despite having lower abundances of pink abalone initially (1983), had significantly more abalone (   H = 9.0; df = 2; p = 0.011) than the nearby fished site over time. Size-frequency distributions revealed that the protected site had more (30\%) commercial-size abalone (≥158 mm shell length) than the less visable site (6\%) or the fished site (2\%). Mean size was significantly larger at the protected site, yielding the highest estimate of biomass and potential egg production (2555 million eggs/site/year) of all the sites. Marine protected areas need to be selected and enforced so that abalone-restoration efforts can be enacted before remnant populations die. Restoration sites for a wide variety of depleted species can be selected based on previous levels of productivity identified by spatially explicit data. Resumen: Las poblaciones de abalón han declinado dramáticamente en California meridional. El abalón blanco (  Haliotis sorenseni) ahora (2001) está en la lista federal de especies en peligro de extinción. Para ayudar a la restauración del abalón blanco, el rosado (   H. corrugata) y el verde (  H. fulgens), se necesita seleccionar áreas marinas protegidas productivas. Utilizamos datos de la industria pesquera (1950–1995) espacialmente explícitos para identificar las áreas marinas más productivas de California meridional. Para evaluar el papel de las áreas marinas protegidas existentes comparamos datos independientes de la industria pesquera (1983–2001) dentro de áreas protegidas y áreas explotadas. La isla de San Clemente produjo las mayores capturas acumulativas de abalón blanco, rosado y verde, la mayor densidad de abalón blanco por hectárea de arrecife profundo (25–65 m), y la mayor densidad de abalón verde por kilómetro de litoral rocoso. Sin embargo, la isla de Santa Bárbara produjo 10 veces más abalón rosado por hectárea de quelpo, haciendo esta área un candidato excelente para la restauración y protección. Los abalones rosados examinados en el Programa de Monitoreo del Bosque de Quelpo fueron más abundantes en tres sitios alrededor de la isla de Anacapa: (1) protegido, (2) protegido, pero menos visible y (3) explotado. Los sitios protegidos, a pesar de tener menor abundancia de abalón rosado inicialmente (1983), en el largo plazo tenían significativamente más abalón (  H = 9.0; gl = 2; p = 0.011) que el sitio explotado próximo. La distribución de frecuencias de tamaño reveló que el sitio protegido tenía más (30\%) abalón de talla comercial (≥158 mm longitud de la concha) que el sitio no regulado (6\%) o el sitio explotado (2\%). La talla promedio era perceptiblemente más grande en el sitio protegido, rindiendo la estimación más alta de biomasa y de producción potencial de huevos (2555 millones de huevos/sitio/año) comparadas con los otros sitios. Las áreas marinas protegidas deben ser seleccionadas y reguladas para poder decretar esfuerzos de restauración del abalón antes de que las poblaciones remanentes mueran. Los sitios de restauración para una amplia variedad de poblaciones agotadas se pueden seleccionar con base en los niveles de la productividad anteriores identificados por datos espacialmente explícitos.},

Mesh size and other characteristics of the trawls used suggested that some of these data were comparable, and could be used to describe changes in demersal fish assemblages over the last 80 years. In Start Bay (NW English Channel) and the Irish Sea, species diversity was the same in both periods, although the most abundant species in each period were not the same. In English coastal regions of the southern North Sea, fish populations became more diverse, as plaice Pleuronectes platessa and whiting Merlangius merlangus became less abundant, and the relative abundance of several non-target species such as dragonet Callionymus spp., bib Trisopterus luscus, and bull-rout Myoxocephalus scorpius increased. The proportion in the catch of small fish species (maximum body length <30 cm), which would be least vulnerable to capture by commercial trawls, increased between the two survey periods in Start Bay and the southern North Sea. None of these small species was commercially exploited. The proportions of larger teleosts (maximum body length >30 cm) in catches decreased in all regions during the time period, except in the Irish Sea where plaice replaced grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus as a dominant species. There was a decline in abundance of large sharks, skates and rays, including the common skate, Raja batis, white skate R. alba and the angel shark Squatina squatina. During historic surveys, 60\% of the elasmobranch fauna consisted of thornback ray Raja clavata, whereas in contemporary surveys the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula was the most abundant elasmobranch. Changes in length-frequency distribution of fish in both target and non-target categories, and other observed changes, were thought to be a response to commercial exploitation, and corresponded to similar observations recorded elsewhere.},

On coral reefs, sharks are strongly interacting apex predators and play a key role in maintaining healthy reef ecosystems [9–11]. Despite increasing fishing pressure, reef shark catches are rarely subject to specific limits, with management approaches typically depending upon no-take marine reserves to maintain populations [12–14]. Here, we reveal that this approach is failing by documenting an ongoing collapse in two of the most abundant reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). We find an order of magnitude fewer sharks on fished reefs compared to no-entry management zones that encompass only 1\% of reefs. No-take zones, which are more difficult to enforce than no-entry zones, offer almost no protection for shark populations. Population viability models of whitetip and gray reef sharks project ongoing steep declines in abundance of 7\% and 17\% per annum, respectively. These findings indicate that current management of no-take areas is inadequate for protecting reef sharks, even in one of the world's most-well-managed reef ecosystems. Further steps are urgently required for protecting this critical functional group from ecological extinction.},

Nevertheless, these mechanisms are objects of selection and evolved to realise adaptive significances. This paper is a plea to bring both fields closer together, and, by means of an example of Diel Vertical Migration of Daphnia, some proximate and ultimate aspects are discussed. It is argued that light changes, not fish kairomone, is the primary cause for an individual to swim downwards at dawn and upwards at dusk. However, what is called a causal factor might differ when ecosystems or individuals are studied. In addition, causality in ecology is not simple, and has the character of a `set of necessary conditions'. To illustrate the importance of proximate analyses in DVM, two basic response mechanisms are discussed: Photobehaviour system 1 and 2. The physiological character of these systems leads to a fixed type of migration or to a phenotypically induced DVM, respectively. The adaptive significance of the first might be a reduction of the hazardous effects of UV radiation and of the second a lowering of mortality due to visually hunting predators.},

  abstract = {Since the year 2000, the designation of remote, large‐scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs) has closed over 15 × 106 km2 of ocean to commercial fishing. Yet, while these mega‐reserves have collectively made a major contribution toward meeting global targets for marine conservation, their effectiveness for the protection of highly mobile, pelagic species remains largely unknown. This study reports on the spatial behavior and reproductive status of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) inhabiting a proposed LSMPA around Ascension Island (tropical Atlantic), with the aim of evaluating the conservation benefits for this economically important species. Using a combination of satellite archival tags and conventional mark–recapture it was shown that individual tuna can remain within Ascension Island waters for periods of between 100 and 200 days, with core residency areas (50\% “utilization distributions”) generally extending <200 km from shore. The vast majority of activity occurred within 92.6 km (50 nmi) of the island and coincided with a “no‐take zone” established around the island in 2016. However, dispersive movements out of this zone were observed in some satellite‐tagged individuals, possibly marking the beginning of more extensive oceanic migrations. Gonad staging of 342 individuals sampled over a 32 month period found no evidence of reproductively active (ripe) individuals, strongly suggesting that tuna foraging around Ascension Island migrate elsewhere to breed. Study results provide further evidence of the importance of oceanic islands as residency areas for pelagic megafauna, helping to justify their inclusion within LSMPAs. In the absence of local recruitment, however, these individuals will remain susceptible to exploitation on spawning grounds located outside of reserves, ultimately limiting their effectiveness and thus calling for further research to identify and protect the areas where species are most vulnerable.},

Crucial insight in animal behaviour and ecosystem functioning and dynamics is gained through acoustic receiver networks that are established in many different environments around the globe. The main limitation to this technique is the ability of the receivers to detect the signals from tagged animals present in the nearby area. To interpret acoustic data correctly, understanding influencing factors on the detection probability is critical. Therefore, range test studies are an essential part of acoustic telemetry research. Here, we investigated whether specific environmental factors (i.e. wind, currents, waves, background noise, receiver tilt and azimuth) influence the receiver detection probability for a permanent acoustic receiver network in Belgium. Noise and wind speed in relation to distance, the interaction of receiver tilt and azimuth and current speed were the most influential variables affecting the detection probability in this environment. The study indicated that there is high detection probability up to a distance of circa 200 m. A new setup, making use of features that render valuable information for data analysis and interpretation, was tested and revealed general applicability.},

  journal = {Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries}, 
  abstract = {In many fish species, some individuals arediurnal while others are nocturnal. Sometimes,the same individual can be diurnal at first andthen switch to nocturnalism, or vice-versa.This review examines the factors that areassociated with such plasticity. It covers thebreakdown of activity rhythms during migration,spawning, and the parental phase; reversals ofactivity patterns during ontogeny or from oneseason to the next; effects of light intensity,temperature, predation risk, shoal size, foodavailability, and intraspecific competition.Case studies featuring goldfish (Carassiusauratus), golden shiner (Notemigonuscrysoleucas), lake chub (Couesiusplumbeus), salmonids, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and parentalsticklebacks and cichlids illustrate some ofthese influences. It is argued that mostspecies have a circadian system but that havingsuch a system does not necessarily imply strictdiurnalism or nocturnalism. Rigidity ofactivity phase seems more common in species,mostly marine, that display behavioral sleep,and for these animals the circadian clock canhelp maintain the integrity of the sleepperiod and ensure that its occurrence takes place atthat time of day to which the animal's sensoryequipment is not as well adapted. However, inother fishes, mostly from freshwater habitats,the circadian clock seems to be used mainly foranticipation of daily events such as thearrival of day, night, or food, and possiblyfor other abilities such as time-place learningand sun compass orientation, rather than forstrict control of activity phase. In thesespecies, various considerations relating toforaging success and predation risk maydetermine whether the animal is diurnal ornocturnal at any particular time and place.},

In addition to site-attached coastal movements observed, several sharks moved entirely across Delaware Bay or spent considerable time in deeper portions of the central bay. Sharks tracked on the New Jersey side of the bay tended to spend more time in deeper water, farther from shore than sharks tracked on the Delaware side. Observation-area curves estimated that optimal tracking time for sandbar sharks in Delaware Bay was 41 h. Indices of site attachment showed that movement patterns of tracked sandbar sharks varied from nomadic to home ranging. There was no significant difference in rate of movement for day/night, crepuscular periods, or between juveniles and neonates. In general, young sandbar sharks patrolled the coast and appeared to be site attached to some extent, but were capable of making longer excursions, including movement entirely across Delaware Bay.},

Ranging behavior of Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) was studied via coastal photo-ID surveys in the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary (BPMMS) between 1985 and 2006. Univariate kernel density estimates of alongshore home range were calculated for 20 individuals with 15 sightings or more. For each individual, sighting locations were transformed into a univariate data set by projecting sightings onto a line drawn 1 km from the coast and measuring the distance along this line relative to an origin. Sightings were weighted by survey effort. Ninety-five percent (K95) of the density estimate was used as a measure of alongshore home range, and 50\% of the estimate (K50) was used to reveal core portions of coastline where dolphins concentrated their activity. The mean estimates of K95 and K50 were 49.69 km (SE = 5.29) and 17.13 km (SE = 1.89), respectively. Four distinct hubs were apparent where the core areas of different individuals coincided. Three of the dolphins' alongshore ranges extended beyond the current northern boundary of the BPMMS, raising fresh concerns that the sanctuary is not large enough. Proposed changes to gill netting regulations, if enacted, will result in the alongshore ranges of all the dolphins in our study being protected.},

The river channel constrained migrations, resulting in linear, one-dimensional encounter histories that included both weir captures and antenna detections. Individual activity centres in a given time period were a function of the individual’s previous estimated location and the river conditions (i.e., gage height). Model results indicate high within-river spawning mortality (mean weekly survival = 0.80) and more extensive movements during elevated river conditions.

  journal = {Scientific Reports}, 
  abstract = {Diving behaviour of short-finned pilot whales is often described by two states; deep foraging and shallow, non-foraging dives. However, this simple classification system ignores much of the variation that occurs during subsurface periods. We used multi-state hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize states of diving behaviour and the transitions between states in short-finned pilot whales. We used three parameters (number of buzzes, maximum dive depth and duration) measured in 259 dives by digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) deployed on 20 individual whales off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA. The HMM identified a four-state model as the best descriptor of diving behaviour. The state-dependent distributions for the diving parameters showed variation between states, indicative of different diving behaviours. Transition probabilities were considerably higher for state persistence than state switching, indicating that dive types occurred in bouts. Our results indicate that subsurface behaviour in short-finned pilot whales is more complex than a simple dichotomy of deep and shallow diving states, and labelling all subsurface behaviour as deep dives or shallow dives discounts a significant amount of important variation. We discuss potential drivers of these patterns, including variation in foraging success, prey availability and selection, bathymetry, physiological constraints and socially mediated behaviour.},

Courtship behavior was inferred for many species from the presence of scars and tooth cuts on the female's body, and noted in more detail from underwater observations. Copulation has been directly observed in captive settings for several species of elasmobranchs in large aquaria, and in the wild for three species of urolophids and for Triaenodon obesus and Ginglymostoma cirratum. A detailed ‘case history’ of nurse shark reproductive behavior is presented that may be used as a template for future work on shark reproductive behavior of other species. Our studies, using diver identifiable tags and in situ behavioral observations, provide unprecedented information on social structure and mating behavior in this species. Since 1993, 115 G. cirratum, 45 adults and 70 juveniles have been tagged in the Dry Tortugas, Florida. Observations show that adult males visit the study site every year with three males dominant. Individual adult females visit the study area to mate in alternate years. Polygyny and polyandry are common.

  abstract = {Home range” is a standard concept in animal ecology and behavior but few people try to understand what home ranges mean to the animals that have them and often assume that a home-range estimate, quantified using some method, is the home range. This leads to 2 problems. First, researchers put much energy into discerning and using the “best” methods for estimating home ranges while no one understands, really, what a home range is. Second, maps delineating home-range estimates may have little connection with what home ranges are and what they mean to the animals that have them. To gain insight into these problems, Roger Powell (hereafter, Roger) documented his own use of space for 65 days, obtaining complete data on where he went, what he did, and how much energy and money he expended and gained in each place. Roger's use of space is consistent with how other mammals use space and, therefore, examination of his data provides insight into what a home range is and how ecologists should approach quantifying other animals' home ranges. We present estimates of Roger's home range in 5 different metrics, or currencies, that provide important and different insights. Home-range estimators that combine different types of information to estimate the spatial distribution and qualities of resources that structure animal behavior (i.e., fitness surfaces) will probably provide the most insight into animals' home ranges. To make reasonable estimates of home ranges, researchers must collect data on habitat, resources, and other attributes of the landscape, so that they can understand basic behaviors of animals and understand how animals may view their environment. We propose that the best concept of a home range is that part of an animal's cognitive map of its environment that it chooses to keep updated.},

  abstract = {Over-exploitation of fisheries is a serious and immediate global problem that current management policies struggle to solve. Scientists and managers accept that new strategies based on a long-term approach are required for future fisheries management policies. But to succeed, such strategies are likely to require more than just attempts by management to control annual levels of exploitation. Recent studies show that using MPAs (marine protected areas, marine reserves) can improve yield as well as protect stocks and sustain fishery viability. In this paper, we use a deliberately simple model, which describes an exploited fishery as a nonlinear dynamical system close to a point of bifurcation; small stochastic perturbations can therefore build up to cause fishery collapse. Extending the model shows that a MPA can buffer this stochasticity and alleviate the propensity to collapse. The model illustrates two main points: (i) evaluating fisheries management strategies such as MPAs in a deterministic framework is inherently misleading; at worst it leads to fishery extinction, at best it fails to maximise yield; (ii) management strategies that are designed explicitly to buffer uncertainty in the system can provide a sustainable and productive fishery. Compared with harvest control rules based on uncertain estimates of stock size, our simulations indicate that MPAs can substantially reduce the risk of fisheries collapse for only a very small cost to total yield.},

In general, fishing activity is permitted within the boundaries of MPAs in Scotland but with different levels of restrictions, thus impacting differently on different sectors of the fishing industry. The present study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the attitudes towards closed areas of Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears. The results show that different gear-users expressed significantly different opinions about closed areas as management tools, their ability to protect stocks and decrease conflicts. Furthermore, a logistic model revealed that, besides the gear-type fishers operate, other characteristics (educational level, location and perceptions of compliance) influence fishers’ opinions about closed areas. Fishers are not a homogeneous collective and the difference in perceptions about closed areas among Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears has important implications for management. Regarding the important role MPAs will play in the long-term conservation and fisheries management plans in Europe, understanding the variability in fishers’ attitudes within the same, and between different, groups will facilitate successful planning and management of MPAs.},

  abstract = {Time series of animal movement obtained from bio-loggers are becoming widely used across all taxa. These data are nowadays of high quality, combining high resolution with precision, as the tags are able to collect for longer times and store larger quantities of data. Due to their nature, high-frequency data sequences often pose non-trivial problems in time series analysis: nonlinearity, non-normality, non-stationarity and long memory. These issues can be tackled by modelling the data sequence as a realization of a stochastic regime-switching process. We suggest a novel Markov switching autoregressive model where the hidden Markov chain is non-homogeneous, with time-varying transition probabilities, whose dynamics depend on the dynamics of some contemporary categorical covariates. To illustrate the use of the method, we apply it to the depth profiles of four individuals of flapper skate (Dipturus cf. intermedia) in order to identify swimming behaviours. Individual time series were obtained from data storage tags that recorded pressure every two minutes. The environmental covariates used were lunar phase (a proxy for the spring-neap tidal cycle), lunar cycle and diel cycle. For all individuals, two states (or regimes) were always selected (the autoregressive order was either three or four), representing different regimes of animal activity, that is state 1 for resting or horizontal swimming or slow vertical movement and state 2 for fast ascending and descending. The cycle of the four lunar phases was the only environmental covariate that explained the hidden state dynamics in all individuals, whereas lunar cycle was selected for two individuals and diel cycle for one only. The method is an efficient approach to fit one-dimensional tag data using categorical environmental covariates, and to classify the observations into a small number of states representing individual behaviours of tagged individuals.},

Additional data obtained from electronic tags attached to six individual flapper skates were used to estimate individual tracks using a tidal-based geolocation model. Concordance between individual tracks and GAM-predicted maps of relative habitat usage (RHU) was tested by comparing predicted RHU between estimated tracks and randomly generated tracks. Environmental suitability for the flapper skate was driven by depth and distance from the coast in the SDM. We found high spatial concordance between the estimated tracks of the six tagged individuals and regions of high RHU predicted by the SDM. Integrating outputs from an independent data source allowed us to validate predictions from a species distribution model (SDM). The integration of individual- and population-level data sources increases confidence in the outputs being used to define spatial conservation measures.

We used dive data from seven gray seals Halichoerus grypus (a primarily benthic forager) collected with GPS phone tags (Sea Mammal Research Unit) to investigate the distribution of the maximum depth visited in each dive. We modeled maximum dive depth as a function of spatiotemporal covariates using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) with individual as a random effect. Bathymetry, horizontal displacement, latitude and longitude, Julian day, sediment type, and light conditions accounted for 37\% of the variability in the data. Persistent patterns of autocorrelation in the raw data suggest that individual intrinsic rhythm might be an important factor, not captured by external covariates. The strength of using this statistical method to generate spatial predictions of the distribution of maximum dive depth is its applicability to other plunge and pursuit divers. Despite being predictions of a point estimate, these maps provide some insight into the third dimension of habitat use in marine animals.

  abstract = {A wide range of instrumentation has been deployed on albatrosses and petrels at Bird Island, South Georgia, in studies dating back to the mid-1980s. Early results indicated the huge distances that albatrosses and large petrels travelled within the breeding season. More recent data show the capacity for sustained ground speeds >100 km h−1, taking advantage of the local wind field. Migrants can cover >750–950 km day−1; one grey-headed albatross circumnavigated the Southern Ocean in only 46 days.2.Improved coverage of different life-history stages and seasons has revealed striking variation in distribution in relation to seasonality of resources and reproductive constraints. There is often a degree of sexual segregation, and, typically, marked individual differences in primary wintering areas and timing of migration that persist from year to year.3.Although there is considerable inter-specific spatial segregation, habitat preferences can overlap, and the intensity of competition is then reduced by differences in behaviour (degree of nocturnal activity, diving capability and manoeuvrability). Migrants appear to avoid congeners and conspecifics from other populations mainly through differences in timing of movements.4.More detailed analyses of activity patterns suggest that birds adjust flight behaviour at multiple spatial scales. Albatrosses are much more active during daylight than darkness probably because they find it more difficult to locate prey at night. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of prey may be captured in darkness using a sit-and-wait tactic. Use of stomach temperature probes also suggests a higher proportion of the diet consists of gelatinous organisms than is indicated from analyses of stomach contents collected at the colony.5.Many albatrosses and large petrels are experiencing widespread population declines. Tracking data that allow the determination of the degree of overlap between birds and fisheries, and hence potential vulnerability to bycatch, are of increasing conservation relevance.

During this period, the Zoological Station in Den Helder (The Netherlands) has collected and registered by-catch species caught by commercial fishermen. The annual numbers of registered specimens were used to estimate the species-specific catch efficiencies of otter and beam trawlers between 1945 and 1983. This analysis was restricted to 7 fishes (sharks, rays, skates) and 10 invertebrate species (whelks, urchins, squids, crabs) all of which have a demersal life style and were regularly delivered throughout the study period. For most species, the observed variations in annual numbers of fish and invertebrates delivered to the Zoological Station appeared to be related to the changes in type of gear and fishing effort. Results from the model suggest that otter trawlers caught relatively more fish than invertebrates, whilst beam trawlers caught proportionally more invertebrate species (i.e. velvet swimming crab, slender spindle shell) that were rarely delivered during periods of greatest otter trawling effort. On average, the catch efficiency of the beam trawl fleet appeared to be 10 times higher than that of the otter trawl fleet. Furthermore, the trends shown by the model in species delivered suggested that bottom fisheries had a considerable impact on several demersal fish and benthic invertebrates.},

  abstract = {Along the East African coast, marine top predators are facing an increasing number of anthropogenic threats which requires the implementation of effective and urgent conservation measures to protect essential habitats. Understanding the role that habitat features play on the marine top predator’ distribution and abundance is a crucial step to evaluate the suitability of an existing Marine Protected Area (MPA), originally designated for the protection of coral reefs. We developed species distribution models (SDM) on the IUCN data deficient Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We followed a comprehensive ecological modelling approach to study the environmental factors influencing the occurrence and abundance of dolphins while developing SDMs. Through the combination of ensemble prediction maps, we defined recurrent, occasional and unfavourable habitats for the species. Our results showed the influence of dynamic and static predictors on the dolphins’ spatial ecology: dolphins may select shallow areas (5-30 m), close to the reefs (< 500 m) and oceanic fronts (< 10 km) and adjacent to the 100m isobath (< 5 km). We also predicted a significantly higher occurrence and abundance of dolphins within the MPA. Recurrent and occasional habitats were identified on large percentages on the existing MPA (47\% and 57\% using presence-absence and abundance models respectively). However, the MPA does not adequately encompass all occasional and recurrent areas and within this context, we propose to extend the MPA to incorporate all of them which are likely key habitats for the highly mobile species. The results from this study provide two key conservation and management tools: (i) an integrative habitat modelling approach to predict key marine habitats, and (ii) the first study evaluating the effectiveness of an existing MPA for marine mammals in the Western Indian Ocean.},

The estimation problem is formulated as a hidden Markov model (HMM) on a spatial grid in continuous time, which allows straightforward implementation of barriers to movement. Using the grid to explicitly resolve space, location estimation can be supplemented by or based entirely on environmental data (e.g. temperature, daylight). The HMM method can therefore analyze any type of electronic tag data. The HMM computes the joint posterior probability distribution of location and behavior at each point in time. With this, the behavioral state of the animal can be associated to regions in space, thus revealing migration corridors and residence areas. We demonstrate the inferential potential of the method by analyzing satellite-linked archival tag data from a southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii where longitudinal coordinates inferred from daylight are supplemented by latitudinal information in recorded sea surface temperatures.},

  abstract = {Observation network data comprise animal presences detected by observer stations at fixed spatial locations. Statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. Advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped.We propose a state-space model (SSM) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. The underlying movement model is an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. An integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. The detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. Since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables.Via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. This result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. Furthermore, we found that the SSM outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. We also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited.The model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device.The presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. By explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.},

Here, we describe an application of a novel FokkerPlanck-based method to geolocate Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea area. In this study, the geolocation relies mainly on matching tidal patterns in depth measurements when a fish spends a prolonged period of time at the seabed with a tidal database. Each day, the method provides a nonparametric probability distribution of the position of a tagged fish and therefore avoids enforcing a particular distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution. In addition to the tidal component of the geolocation, the model incoporates two behavioural states, either high or low activity, estimated directly from the depth data, that affect the diffusivity parameter of the model and improves the precision and realism of the geolocation significantly. The new method provides access to the probability distribution of the position of the fish that in turn provides a range of useful descriptive statistics, such as the path of the most probable movement. We compare the method with existing alternatives and discuss its potential in making population inference from archival tag data.},

Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development. 2.  In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner. 3.  It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters. 4.  To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.},

New approaches of ever greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper, we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful classes of statistical models used to analyse individual animal movement data. Specifically, we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology towards what are arguably overly complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists, unwieldy with large data sets or not based on mainstream statistical practice. Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g. based on Lévy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic, whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.},

  abstract = {Satellite transmitters and geographic-positioning-system devices often add substantial mass to birds to which they are attached. Studies on the effects of such instruments have focused on indirect measures, whereas the direct influence of extra mass on pelagic behavior is poorly known. We used 2.5-g geolocators to investigate the effect of extra mass on the pelagic behavior of Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) by comparing the traits of a single foraging trip among a group carrying 30-g weights, a group carrying 60-g weights, and a control group. The weights were attached to the birds' backs using typical techniques for attaching satellite transmitters to seabirds. The extra mass increased the duration of the birds' trips and decreased their foraging efficiency and mass gained at sea. These indirect effects may be related to foraging traits: weighted birds showed a greater search effort than control birds, traveled greater distances, covered a greater foraging area, and increased the maximum foraging range. Furthermore, the time spent on the sea surface at night was greater for weighted than for control groups, which showed that the extra mass also affected activity patterns. Our results underline the need to quantify the effects of monitoring equipment commonly used to study the pelagic behavior of seabirds. We suggest that geolocators can be used to obtain control data on foraging-trip movements and activity patterns.Los transmisores satelitales y los aparatos con sistemas de posicionamiento geográfico frecuentemente agregan un peso substancial a las aves a las que se los sujetan. Los estudios sobre los efectos de estos instrumentes se han enfocado en medidas indirectas, mientras que la influencia directa del peso extra en el comportamiento pelágico es poco conocida. Empleamos localizadores geográficos de 2.5 g para investigar el efecto del peso extra sobre el comportamiento pelágico de Calonectris diomedea mediante la comparación de los rasgos de un único viaje de forrajeo entre un grupo de aves que portaba pesos de 30 g, un grupo que portaba pesos de 60 g y un grupo control. Los pesos fueron colocados sobre la espalda de las aves usando las técnicas típicas para sujetar los transmisores satelitales a las aves marinas. El peso extra incremento la duración de los viajes de las aves y disminuyó su eficiencia de forrajeo y el peso corporal adquirido en el mar. Estos efectos indirectes pueden estar relacionados con los rasgos de forrajeo: las aves con pesos suplementarios mostraron un esfuerzo de búsqueda mayor que las aves control, viajaron distancias más grandes, cubrieron un área de forrajeo mayor e incrementaron el ámbito máximo de forrajeo. Más aún, el tiempo pasado sobre la superficie del mar durante la noche fue mayor para los grupos con peso suplementario que para los grupos control, lo que mostró que el peso suplementario también afectó los patrones de actividad. Nuestros resultados destacan la necesidad de cuantificar los efectos del equipo de monitoreo usado comúnmente para estudiar el comportamiento pelágico de las aves marinas. Sugerimos que los localizadores geográficos pueden ser usados para obtener dates de control de los movimientos de los viajes de forrajeo y de los patrones de actividad.},

  abstract = {Central place foragers (CPF) rest within a central place, and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur ‘travelling’ costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate ‘activity seascapes’, which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.},

For ectothermic predators, ambient temperature may also influence daily routines through its effects on physiological performance. Temperatures can fluctuate significantly over the diel cycle and ectotherms may synchronize behaviour to match thermal regimes in order to optimize fitness. We used bio-logging to quantify activity and body temperature of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at a tropical atoll. Behavioural observations were used to concurrently measure bite rates in herbivorous reef fishes, as an index of activity for potential diurnal prey. Sharks showed early evening peaks in activity, particularly during ebbing high tides, while body temperatures peaked several hours prior to the period of maximal activity. Herbivores also displayed peaks in activity several hours earlier than the peaks in shark activity. Sharks appeared to be least active while their body temperatures were highest and most active while temperatures were cooling, although we hypothesize that due to thermal inertia they were still warmer than their smaller prey during this period. Sharks may be most active during early evening periods as they have a sensory advantage under low light conditions and/or a thermal advantage over cooler prey. Sharks swam into shallow water during daytime low tide periods potentially to warm up and increase rates of digestion before the nocturnal activity period, which may be a strategy to maximize ingestion rates. “Hunt warm, rest warmer” may help explain the early evening activity seen in other ectothermic predators.},

Sharks had relatively small home ranges over a timescale of days to weeks (0.55 ± 0.24 km2) and showed strong site fidelity to sand-flat ledges within the west lagoon over a three-year period. Sharks showed evidence of diel and tidal movements, and they utilized certain regions of the west lagoon disproportionately. There were ontogenetic shifts in habitat selection, with smaller sharks showing greater selection for sand-flat habitats, and pups (total length 35–61 cm) utilizing very shallow waters on sand-flats, potentially as nursery areas. Adult sharks selected ledge habitats and had lower rates of movement when over sand-flats and ledges than they did over lagoon waters. Fractal analysis of movements showed that over periods of days, sharks used patches that were 3–17\% of the scale of their home range. Repeat horizontal movements along ledge habitats consisted of relatively straight movements, which theoretical models consider the most efficient search strategy when forage patches may be spatially and temporally unpredictable. Although sharks moved using a direct walk while in patches, they appeared to move randomly between patches. Microhabitat quantity and quality had large effects on blacktip reef shark movements, which have consequences for the life-history characteristics of the species and potentially the spatial distribution of behaviorally mediated effects on lower trophic levels throughout the Palmyra ecosystem.},

While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used  10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small ‘sub‐habitats’ with very few movements of individuals between sub‐habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra‐specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual‐based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat‐specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef. We provide compelling evidence that competition helps drive distribution patterns and spatial separation of a marine predator community, and highlight that competitive advantages may not be constant but rather dependent on habitats.},

Prime among these findings was the discovery that, occasionally, one of the two daily peaks in an organism's rhythm assumed a different period from its partner. Similar results have since been observed in a host of different organisms. These data led to the circalunidian-clock hypothesis that envisions two basic 24.8 h clocks, coupled together in antiphase, as the driving force for these rhythms. There is, however, only a slight difference (50 minutes) in running times between a solar-day clock with a period of approximately 24 h and a lunar-day clock with a period of approximately 24.8 h, both of which display “circa” periods that overlap.

Habitat use across the footprint of the array differed, with most detections occurring in coastal areas and comparatively fewer in deeper mosaic or shelf habitats. Linear home range estimates revealed that some barracuda moved >12 km within a single day and are capable of migrating >100 km to other islands in the Bahamian Archipelago.

  abstract = {In order to better understand the associative behavior of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) with anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs), we conducted long-term monitoring of these tuna tagged with ultrasonic transmitters, using automated receivers deployed on seven FADs around the Okinawa Islands. Current and surface water temperature were also monitored by data loggers attached to the stations as a way to examine the influence of these factors on the associative behavior of tuna with FADs. We monitored a total of 52 yellowfin and 11 bigeye tuna at monitoring FADs for a period of 2.5 years. We found that the majority of tuna remained continuously at the monitoring stations for a certain period (max.=55 days) without day-scale (>24 h) absences, until they left the stations completely. The residence time at a single FAD was estimated to be about 7 days, as the half-life for both yellowfin and bigeye tuna. No inter-specific differences were seen, though there was a significant difference in residence time between two size classes: the residence time of the larger size class was shorter than that of the smaller size class. We also found there was a periodicity of approximately 24 h and regularity of associative behavior, estimated based on the fluctuation pattern of the detection rate and of short-term (<24 h) absences. In particular, absences of several hours occurring once a day with high temporal precision were considered to be excursions within several nautical miles from the FADs. These results indicate that tuna express periodic behavior in relation to the FADs and can locate the FADs precisely enough to return to them after a certain time. No relationship was seen between associative behavior and abiotic oceanographic conditions. Therefore, the biological environment (prey availability, the presence of predators, etc.) and the internal state of the individual (hunger, etc.) may be more important than abiotic environmental cues for inducing changes in associative behavior and/or the departure from FADs. In addition, the strong association of tuna with a single FAD and the relatively prolonged residence time observed in the present study may relate to the vigorous activity of FAD fisheries in Okinawa and their utilization of a large amount of bait.},

Thirty-nine cod have been recaptured up to 608 days later, throughout the year and, in all but two cases, within 15 km of their release site. Geolocation methods based on temperature and bathymetry also suggested that the cod had a limited home range, remaining resident year-round in coastal waters. The cod were deeper during the winter and moved to shallower water in late spring and summer. They showed diel, fortnightly and monthly cycles in depth movement that varied much within and between individuals over the season.

  journal = {Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems}, 
  abstract = {1. In order to evaluate if marine protected areas (MPAs) can be expected to confer conservation benefits to large, mobile marine species it is important to assess their site fidelity and habitat ranging patterns. The flapper skate (Dipterus cf. intermedia) is a large, threatened elasmobranch for which MPAs are being considered on the west coast of Scotland. To inform MPA establishment, a multiannual mark–recapture programme, a year-long static array acoustic study and an archival tagging study of flapper skate were undertaken.
2. Capture–mark–recapture (CMR) modelling of 280 individuals indicated significant heterogeneity in the recapture rate suggesting the region contained a mixture of site-attached (resident) and vagrant (transient) individuals. The analysis estimated that 100–400 resident individuals were present in the study area. The number of transient individuals was estimated at around 25\% of all those tagged. The average annual survival probability of resident individuals was estimated to be 0.64.
3. The acoustic study of 20 individuals demonstrated that over half were resident on a day-by-day basis for months at a time. Three individuals were detected over the entire year. Two individuals moved away immediately after tagging and over half moved out of the study area in the springtime.
4. Three data storage tags revealed that resident individuals utilized most of the available depth habitat (6–205 m) in the area and occasionally visited deeper areas outside the immediate study area.
5. The results indicate that the establishment of a MPA would confer conservation benefits to flapper skate in the area. Management should consider all depths in the study area, areas beyond the study site, and alternative conservation measures such as technical gear measures for fisheries. This study has implications for the conservation and management of similar long-lived, mobile marine species.},

Evidence suggests that marine management and con- servation strategies, whether directed towards the environment or fisheries, are only slowly taking account of the time-scales of endogenously controlled rhythmic animal behaviour as a basis from which to achieve their objectives. Similarly, in com- mercial aquaculture practices, there is a need for greater evaluation of the role of photoperiod manipulation and optimiza- tion of feeding regimes against the background of the endogenous rhythmicity of the organisms concerned.

Twenty-one prey items belonging to four major groups (stomatopods, decapods, mollusks and fish) were identified. Decapod crustaceans were the most abundant prey found in stomachs. The mantis shrimp Squilla panamensis was the main prey item in the diet of M. lunulatus; tiger shrimp Trachypenaeus sp. was the main prey item in the diet of Rhinobatos leucorhynchus and Raja velezi, and Penaeidae shrimp were the main prey items in the diet of Z. xyster. Furthermore, fish were important in the diet of Raja velezi, Z. xyster and D. longa. The greatest diet breadth corresponded to Z. xyster whereas M. lunulatus was the most specialized predator. Finally, four significant diet overlaps between the five species were found, attributable mainly to Squillidae, Penaeidae and Fish. Shrimps (Penaeidae and stomatopods) and benthic fishes were the most important food types in the diet of the elasmobranch species studied. Diet breadth and overlap were relatively low. Determination of food resource partitioning among the batoid species studied was not possible. However, we identified partitions in other niche axes (time of feeding activity and habitat utilization). It is possible to assume that diffuse competition could be exceeding the biunivocal competition among the studied species. Therefore, this assemblage would have a strong tendency to trophic guild formation.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)},

We constructed trajectories of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning of exploitation. Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80\% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10\% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions5 have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems5,6,7. Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the ‘missing baseline’8 needed for future restoration efforts.},

These restrictions are poorly suited for monitoring the development of living elasmobranchs inside their egg cases. There are two major aims of this study. The first was to observe elasmobranch embryonic development non-invasively and produce a non-invasive developmental key for identifying the life stages for an elasmobranch inside the egg case. To this end, 7 key developmental stages were identified for the greater spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus stellaris, and are provided here with diagrams from multiple perspectives to demonstrate the key features of each stage. The physiological and ecological relevance of each stage are discussed in terms of structure and function for embryonic survival in the harsh intertidal zone. Also discussed is the importance of the egg case membrane and the protective embryonic jelly. The second aim of the study was to understand the applicability of the 7 developmental stages from S. stellaris to other oviparous elasmobranchs. Thus, changes in embryonic body size and egg yolk volume at each stage were measured and compared with those of the closely related, lesser spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula. We find nearly identical growth patterns and yolk consumption patterns in both species across the 7 developmental stages. Thus, although the 7 developmental stages have been constructed in reference to the greater spotted catshark, we suggest that it can be applied to other oviparous elasmobranch species with only minor modification.},

  journal = {Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Unlike smaller raptors, which can readily use flapping flight, large raptors are mainly restricted to soaring flight due to energetic constraints. Soaring comprises of two main strategies: thermal and orographic soaring. These soaring strategies are driven by discrete uplift sources determined by the underlying topography and meteorological conditions in an area. High‐resolution GPS tracking of raptor flight allows the identification of these flight strategies and interpretation of the spatiotemporal occurrence of thermal and orographic soaring. In this study, we develop methods to identify soaring flight behaviors from high‐resolution GPS tracking data of Verreaux’s eagle Aquila verreauxii and analyze these data to understand the conditions that promote the use of thermal and orographic soaring. We use these findings to predict the use of soaring flight both spatially (across the landscape) and temporally (throughout the year) in two topographically contrasting regions in South Africa. We found that topography is important in determining the occurrence of soaring flight and that thermal soaring occurs in relatively flat areas which are likely to have good thermal uplift availability. The predicted use of orographic soaring was predominately determined by terrain slope. Contrary to our expectations, the topography and meteorology of eagle territories in the Sandveld promoted the use of soaring flight to a greater extent than in territories in the more mountainous Cederberg region. Spatiotemporal mapping of predicted flight behaviors can broaden our understanding of how large raptors like the Verreaux’s eagle use their habitat and how that links to energetics (as the preferential use of areas that maximize net energy gain is expected), reproductive success, and ultimately population dynamics. Understanding the fine‐scale landscape use and environmental drivers of raptor flight can also help to predict and mitigate potential detrimental effects of anthropogenic developments, such as mortality via collision with wind turbines. High‐resolution GPS tracking of soaring birds can allow the identification of distinct flight strategies, which are associated with the occurrence of uplift in the environment. This article examines the topographic and meteorological variables associated with two forms of soaring flight (orographic and thermal) and predicts the probability of their use spatially (across the landscape) and temporally (throughout the year). These methods can broaden our understanding of ecological energy constraints or be applied to predict the probability of flight strategies, which are particularly relevant to the growing wind energy industry.},

However, despite the rapid increase in studies focused on measuring the dietary and habitat selection patterns of sharks, discussion on how to define the ecological specialisation of sharks has been limited. This is an impediment to communication and research as definitions of specialisation and how to measure it vary based on context. This review presents a conceptual framework within which to define the specialisation of sharks that can be applied to different environmental scales and goals. We present examples of species with varying degrees of specialisation at large and small scales within the proposed context. The effects of specialisation on population stability are also briefly discussed. Specialists are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations and thus more susceptible to population depletion following environmental changes. Therefore identifying specialised species is key to understanding species vulnerabilities and advancing ecological discussions.},

This study used acoustic and archival telemetry data from two lakes in southern Labrador, Canada, to study thermal habitat use during the ice-covered period. Results showed that lake-dwelling anadromous Arctic char predominantly occupied a narrow range of temperatures (0.5–2 °C) and used cooler temperatures available within the middle and upper water column. Use of the selected temperatures is likely a strategy that lowers metabolic costs and minimizes energy expenditure, preserving stored lipids for overwinter survival and the energetic costs of preparation for seaward migration. As Arctic char are visual feeders, use of the upper water column is also thought to aid foraging efficiency by increasing the likelihood of prey capture.},

This study described and quantified the diet composition of R. agassizii by means of stomach analysis contents in the periods 2005-2006 and 2012-2013. We analyzed and quantified stomach contents in terms of abundance (\%N), weight (\%M), frequency of occurrence (\% FO), and index of relative importance (IRI). The results showed differences in the food rates between the periods. However, the groups of food items were the same: Teleostei fish, decapods, and mollusks. In 2005-2006, the diet consisted mainly of shrimp, however, in 2012-2013 it consisted of fish, followed by decapods, especially shrimps. The differences in diets may be attributed to shrimp abundance, which do not characterize a change in the eating habits in 2012-2013, because, in addition to fish, shrimps were also important food sources. The presence of a certain prey is more related to its availability rather than the feeding preference of skate. The amount of ingested items is associated to biological and environmental factors, so that further studies relating diet with capture area, seasonality, depth, and other factors should be conducted.},

  journal = {Animal Behaviour}, 
  abstract = {Although theoretical models predict that the quality of foraging patches has little effect on optimal dive time with increasing depth, many empirical studies show that dive time at a given depth may vary. We developed a model that incorporated patch quality as a parameter of energy intake as a nonlinear function of time, and applied it to the diving behaviour of Brünnich's guillemots, Uria lomvia. The model indicated that optimal dive time can vary widely depending on the parameter. It also explained the convergence of observed dive times with travel time. Assuming the birds dived optimally, this parameter can be estimated from travel time and dive time for each dive. Foraging patches with larger estimated parameter values were favoured by the birds, suggesting that the parameter indicated patch quality. We used this parameter to test an optimal patch use model in divers. The results indicate that Brünnich's guillemots adjust their diving behaviour adaptively depending on patch quality, and that the optimal diving model is valid for prediction of observed dive patterns if patch quality is incorporated appropriately.

  journal = {Marine Policy}, 
  abstract = { By 2019, the Common Fisheries Policy will prohibit discarding in all European fisheries of any pelagic, demersal or shellfish species for which removals are managed by TACs and quotas or minimum sizes. However, the regulation allows for exemptions from the prohibition for species for which scientific evidence demonstrates high survival rates associated with discarding. Producing reliable evidence of high survival typically requires long and costly studies involving tagging or captivity. This paper proposes to use the capacity to resist air exposure, a key stressor for discarded animals, as a proxy for survival that can be used to prioritize candidate species for more in-depth discard survival studies. The time required to induce mortality (TM) in air-exposed fish was estimated for ten discarded species under commercial fishing conditions for two artisanal French otter trawlers in the Bay of Biscay and in the English Channel. European seabass, plaice, sole and skates had extended TM values on average, suggesting that these species are good candidates. The three species observed in both regions (plaice, sole and skates) had larger TM values in the English Channel experiment compared to the Bay of Biscay experiment. Among the four measured external conditions that could influence TM (air temperature, fish length, tow depth and tow duration), the air temperature was the most important and the factor that most distinguished the two experiments.},

  journal = {Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries}, 
  abstract = {Over the last few decades, much effort has been devoted towards quantifying and reducing bycatch in marine fisheries. Of late, there has been a particular focus on sharks given that bycatch is a frequently listed threat for sharks on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. However, currently there are no quantitative reviews or syntheses that explore the issue of shark bycatch globally which is problematic given that such a synthesis could inform conservation actions and identify pressing research gaps. We performed a qualitative and quantitative survey of the peer-reviewed literature to characterize trends in shark bycatch research with a particular goal of identifying research needs and opportunities. Using a structured literature review we identified 103 papers that met our search criteria, with the first one published in 1993. Early research efforts focused on documenting the scope of bycatch (i.e., determining that sharks were indeed captured as bycatch), but more recently there have been increased efforts devoted to developing and evaluating bycatch reduction strategies for sharks. Research activity was most common in the North Atlantic (\textbackslashtextasciitilde40 \% of the total articles analysed) with comparatively less research in other areas such as the Indo-Pacific region where shark bycatch is regarded as particularly common and problematic. Most studies were observational with comparatively fewer experimental and modeling studies, and even fewer that combined research approaches. Gear modifications (e.g., hook size and type for long lines, net size and mesh design for nets) were the most commonly evaluated strategy for reducing shark bycatch; however, development and use of techniques like repellents, or seasonal area closures, or a combination of strategies, offer interesting possibilities that require further study. In addition, although many sharks are discarded, little is known about post-release survival or sub-lethal consequences of fisheries interactions, or evaluations of different fish handling strategies, making it difficult to quantify the true cost of bycatch or to recommend handling strategies to fishers. Although there are some inherent challenges with developing and testing shark bycatch reduction strategies, there is an urgent need to do so and this would be best achieved through interdisciplinary research that spans field, laboratory, and modeling realms.},

Large telemetry and tracking data sets have been collected for this group of animals, and are accompanied by many empirical studies that seek to segment tracks in some useful way, as well as theoretical studies of optimal foraging strategies. However, relatively few studies have detailed statistical methods for inferring behaviors in central place foraging trips. In this paper we describe an approach based on hidden Markov models, which splits foraging trips into segments labeled as “outbound”, “search”, “forage”, and “inbound”. By structuring the hidden Markov model transition matrix appropriately, the model naturally handles the sequence of behaviors within a foraging trip. Additionally, by structuring the model in this way, we are able to develop realistic simulations from the fitted model. We demonstrate our approach on data from southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) tagged on Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean. We discuss the differences between our 4‐state model and the widely used 2‐state model, and the advantages and disadvantages of employing a more complex model.},

For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus.

This revolution began in the 1950s and 1960s with the first studies utilizing acoustic and radio transmitters to actively track fish movements. Subsequent decades saw the development of passive monitoring systems enabling researchers to scale up the number of individuals followed, and the duration and spatial extent of tracking studies. Recent decades also have witnessed the increasingly-widespread use of sophisticated satellite transmitters to quantify fish movements in remote parts of the ocean beyond the range of fixed listening arrays. Most recently, high-frequency sampling devices incorporating accelerometers and other novel sensors have given us unparalleled new and detailed insights into fish behavior. All of these technologies have yielded important insights into fish spatial behaviors, and shown that many species are most active at night, or in deep waters, but we need better ground-truthing to reveal the full context and purpose of these spatial patterns. Recent advances in animal-mounted cameras have provided important ground-truthing breakthroughs, allowing us to see behavior and habitat use from the fishes' own perspective. However, current generations of animal-mounted cameras are reliant on natural light, or use artificial light overlapping the visual spectrum of most fishes. To see what fishes are doing at night, we need to develop new animal-mounted cameras using far red spectrum light, or high-frequency sound, to illuminate the view field without impacting natural behavior.},

Daytime habitat use patterns of two of these fish were continuously monitored for one month using a fixed hydrophone hardwired to an onshore computer. Acoustically tagged fish showed consistent diel patterns of behavior, refuging in holes in the reef by day and moving over extensive areas of sand and coral rubble habitat at night. Remote monitoring of daytime habitat use by two goatfish revealed that the same daytime refuge was used by both fish for at least one month (the battery life of the transmitters). Home ranges of all fish were within the boundaries of the Coconut Island reserve suggesting that even small areas containing suitable habitat can make effective reserves for this species. A relatively low abundance of reproductive size P. porphyreus at Coconut Island in comparison with deeper areas may indicate an ontogenetic shift to deeper habitat in this species.},

Here we test which hypothesis predicts DVM in the small planktivorous coregonids vendace, Coregonus albula, and Fontane cisco, Coregonus fontanae, in a deep oligotrophic lake. Densities and population depths of young-of-the-year and larger coregonids were determined by hydroacoustics during day and night over 10 consecutive months. Depth distributions of predator-like fishes and zooplankton resources were recorded as well. Furthermore, Secchi depth, water temperature, oxygen concentrations, and pH values were determined at each sampling month. A DVM of the coregonids was observed in all months. Population depths during the night were significantly correlated to water temperatures, oxygen concentrations, and pH values. In contrast, the vertical distributions of predators or resources were not correlated with the coregonid depth distribution. These results do not correspond to the feeding opportunity or predator avoidance hypotheses of DVM, but support in part the bioenergetics efficiency hypothesis. However, the stable migration pattern of fishes over all months despite substantial changes in biotic and abiotic conditions suggests that diel migrations in the coregonids are a genetically fixed behavioral trait to minimize the anticipated potential predation risk in the illuminated water layers during daytime.},

  abstract = {Current debates about the efficacy of no-take marine reserves (MR) in protecting large pelagic fish such as tuna and sharks have usually not considered the evolutionary dimension of this issue, which emerges because the propensity to swim away from a given place, like any other biological trait, will probably vary in a heritable fashion among individuals. Here, based on spatially explicit simulations, we investigated whether selection to remain in MRs to avoid higher fishing mortality can lead to the evolution of more philopatric fish. Our simulations, which covered a range of life histories among tuna species (skipjack tuna vs. Atlantic bluefin tuna) and shark species (great white sharks vs. spiny dogfish), suggested that MRs were most effective at maintaining viable population sizes when movement distances were lowest. Decreased movement rate evolved following the establishment of marine reserves, and this evolution occurred more rapidly with higher fishing pressure. Evolutionary reductions in movement rate led to increases in within-reserve population sizes over the course of the 50 years following MR establishment, although this varied among life histories, with skipjack responding fastest and great white sharks slowest. Our results suggest the evolution of decreased movement can augment the efficacy of marine reserves, especially for species, such as skipjack tuna, with relatively short generation times. Even when movement rates did not evolve substantially over 50 years (e.g., given long generation times or little heritable variation), marine reserves were an effective tool for the conservation of fish populations when mean movement rates were low or MRs were large.},

Our goals in this review are to describe the conceptual origins of multi-scale habitat selection modeling, evaluate the current state-of-the-science, and suggest ways forward to improve analysis of scale-dependent habitat selection. We reviewed more than 800 papers on habitat selection from 23 major ecological journals published between 2009 and 2014 and recorded a number of characteristics, such as whether they addressed habitat selection at multiple scales, what attributes of scale were evaluated, and what analytical methods were utilized. Our results show that despite widespread recognition of the importance of multi-scale analyses of habitat relationships, a large majority of published habitat ecology papers do not address multiple spatial or temporal scales. We also found that scale optimization, which is critical to assess scale dependence, is done in less than 5 \% of all habitat selection modeling papers and less than 25 \% of papers that address “multi-scale” habitat analysis broadly defined. Our review confirms the existence of a powerful conceptual foundation for multi-scale habitat selection modeling, but that the majority of studies on wildlife habitat are still not adopting multi-scale frameworks. Most importantly, our review points to the need for wider adoption of a formal scale optimization of organism response to environmental variables.},

  abstract = {Animal-attached sensors are increasingly used to provide insights on behaviour and physiology. However, such tags usually lack information on the structure of the surrounding environment from the perspective of a study animal and thus may be unable to identify potentially important drivers of behaviour. Recent advances in robotics and computer vision have led to the availability of integrated depth-sensing and motion-tracking mobile devices. These enable the construction of detailed 3D models of an environment within which motion can be tracked without reliance on GPS. The potential of such techniques has yet to be explored in the field of animal biotelemetry. This report trials an animal-attached structured light depth-sensing and visual–inertial odometry motion-tracking device in an outdoor environment (coniferous forest) using the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) as a compliant test species. A 3D model of the forest environment surrounding the subject animal was successfully constructed using point clouds. The forest floor was labelled using a progressive morphological filter. Trees trunks were modelled as cylinders and identified by random sample consensus. The predicted and actual presence of trees matched closely, with an object-level accuracy of 93.3\%. Individual points were labelled as belonging to tree trunks with a precision, recall, and Fβ score of 1.00, 0.88, and 0.93, respectively. In addition, ground-truth tree trunk radius measurements were not significantly different from random sample consensus model coefficient-derived values. A first-person view of the 3D model was created, illustrating the coupling of both animal movement and environment reconstruction. Using data collected from an animal-borne device, the present study demonstrates how terrain and objects (in this case, tree trunks) surrounding a subject can be identified by model segmentation. The device pose (position and orientation) also enabled recreation of the animal’s movement path within the 3D model. Although some challenges such as device form factor, validation in a wider range of environments, and direct sunlight interference remain before routine field deployment can take place, animal-borne depth sensing and visual–inertial odometry have great potential as visual biologging techniques to provide new insights on how terrestrial animals interact with their environments.},

Integrating multiple data streams can not only reveal hidden behaviors and ecological relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to infer from location data alone, but also facilitate more realistic path reconstruction that respects important ecological features while bridging the information gaps that commonly arise due to measurement error or missing data. Using the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), a benthic predator associated with Arctic sea ice, we demonstrate how integrating location, dive activity, land cover, bathymetry, and sea ice data in a unified modeling framework allowed us to identify novel behavior states, such as hauling out on seasonal sea ice and those associated with competing foraging strategies (i.e., benthic vs. mid-water prey). By utilizing multiple data streams, ecologists can move beyond conventional two-state models (“foraging” and “transit”) and address more interesting hypotheses about activity budgets, resource selection, and many other areas of movement and behavioral ecology. The generality of our approach provides broad applicability to marine and terrestrial species, as well as many types of biotelemetry and environmental data.},

  journal = {Ecology}, 
  abstract = {  Recent technological advances have permitted the collection of detailed animal
 location and ancillary biotelemetry data that facilitate inference about animal movement and
 associated   behaviors.   However,   these   rich  sources   of   individual   information,   location,   and
 biotelemetry   data,   are   typically   analyzed   independently,   with   population-level   inferences
 remaining largely post hoc. We describe a hierarchical modeling approach, which is able to
 integrate location and ancillary biotelemetry (e.g., physiological or accelerometer) data from
 many   individuals.   We   can   thus   obtain   robust   estimates   of   (1)   population-level   movement
 parameters and (2) activity budgets for a set of behaviors among which animals transition as
 they respond to changes in their internal and external environment. Measurement error and
 missing   data   are   easily   accommodated   using   a   state-space   formulation   of   the   proposed
 hierarchical model. Using Bayesian analysis methods, we demonstrate our modeling approach
 with   location   and   dive   activity   data   from   17   harbor   seals   (Phoca   vitulina)   in   the   United
 Kingdom.   Based   jointly   on   movement   and   diving   activity,   we   identied   three   distinct
 movement   behavior   states:   resting,   foraging,   and   transit,   and   estimated   population-level
 activity budgets to these three states. Because harbor seals are known to dive for both foraging
 and transit (but not usually for resting), we compared these results to a similar population-
 level analysis utilizing only location data. We found that a large proportion of time steps were
 mischaracterized when behavior states were inferred from horizontal trajectory alone, with
 33\% of time steps exhibiting a majority of dive activity assigned to the resting state. Only 1\%
 of   these   time   steps   were   assigned   to   resting   when   inferred   from   both   trajectory   and   dive
 activity   data   using   our   integrated   modeling   approach.   There   is   mounting   evidence   of   the
 potential perils of inferring animal behavior based on trajectory alone, but there fortunately
 now exist many exible analytical techniques for extracting more out of the increasing wealth
 of information afforded by recent advances in biologging technology.},

Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

To protect breeding adults, we require knowledge of animal movements, how movement relates to political boundaries, and our confidence in spatial analyses of movement. We used satellite tracking and a switching state-space model to determine the internesting movements of olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (n = 18) in Central Africa during two breeding seasons (2007-08, 2008-09). These movements were analyzed in relation to current park boundaries and a proposed transboundary park between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, both created to reduce unintentional bycatch of sea turtles in marine fisheries. We additionally determined confidence intervals surrounding home range calculations. Turtles remained largely within a 30 km radius from the original nesting site before departing for distant foraging grounds. Only 44.6 percent of high-density areas were found within the current park but the proposed transboundary park would incorporate 97.6 percent of high-density areas. Though tagged individuals originated in Gabon, turtles were found in Congolese waters during greater than half of the internesting period (53.7 percent), highlighting the need for international cooperation and offering scientific support for a proposed transboundary park. This is the first comprehensive study on the internesting movements of solitary nesting olive ridley sea turtles, and it suggests the opportunity for tractable conservation measures for female nesting olive ridleys at this and other solitary nesting sites around the world. We draw from our results a framework for cost-effective protection of long-lived species using satellite telemetry as a primary tool.},

  abstract = {Declines in large vertebrate populations are widespread but difficult to detect from monitoring data and hard to understand due to a multiplicity of plausible biological explanations. In parts of Scotland, harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) have been in decline for 10 years. To evaluate the contributions of different proximate causes (survival, fecundity, observation artefacts) to this decline, we collated behavioural, demographic and population data from one intensively studied population in part of the Moray Firth (north-east Scotland). To these, we fit a state-space model comprising age-structured dynamics and a detailed account of observation errors. After accounting for culling (estimated by our model as 14 \% of total mortality), the main driver of the historical population decline was a decreasing trend in survival of young individuals combined with (previously unrecognised) low levels of pupping success. In more recent years, the model provides evidence for considerable increases in breeding success and consistently high levels of adult survival. However, breeding success remains the most volatile demographic component of the population. Forecasts from the model indicate a slow population recovery, providing cautious support for recent management measures. Such investigations of the proximate causes of population change (survival, fecundity and observation errors) provide valuable short-term support for the management of population declines, helping to focus future data collection on those ultimate causal mechanisms that are not excluded by the demographic evidence. The contribution of specific ultimate drivers (e.g. shooting mortality or competitors) can also be quantified by including them as covariates to survival or fecundity.},

The outer bay (the outermost 8 km) is characterized by oceanic conditions while the shallow inner bay (the innermost 12 km) features wide seasonal temperature shifts. Five rays were tracked monthly from October 1990 to November 1991 and six rays (four of which carried temperature-sensing transmitters) were tracked daily from 30 June to 16 July 1992. Mean bat ray movement rate was 8.84 m min−1 (range 4.49 to 13.40 m min−1) and was not significantly affected by size (p=0.592), tidal stage (p=0.610), or time of day (p=0.327). Movement direction was unrelated to tidal stage (p=0.472) but showed a highly significant diel pattern (p<0.001). From 2:50–14:50 h, rays moved toward the warmer and shallower inner bay, while from 14:50–2:50 h they moved toward the cooler and deeper outer bay. These telemetry data, along with known bat ray foraging patterns and respiratory temperature-sensitivity, argue for behavioral thermoregulation as the primary influence on this movement pattern.},

  abstract = {Fish entrainment through turbine intakes is one of the major issues for operators of hydropower facilities because it causes injury and/or mortality and adversely affects population abundance. Entrainment reduction strategies have been developed based on the behavior of downstream migrating fishes, particularly diadromous species. However, knowledge of the behavior of migratory fishes has very limited application for reducing the entrainment of resident fishes, including several species that represent important recreational and aboriginal fishery resources in reservoirs. In this study, we used fine-scale acoustic telemetry and state-space modeling to investigate behavioral attributes associated with entrainment risk of resident adult bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in a large hydropower reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. We found that adult bull trout resided longer in the vicinity of the powerhouse and moved closer to the turbine intakes in the fall and particularly in the winter. Bull trout were more likely to engage in exploratory behavior (characteristic of foraging or reduced activity) during periods when their body temperature was lower or higher than 6°C. We also detected diel changes in behavioral attributes, with bull trout distance to intakes and probability of exploratory behavior slightly increasing at night. We hypothesize that the exploratory behavior in the forebay is associated with foraging for kokanee (nonanadromous form of Oncorhynchus nerka), which have been shown to congregate near the dams of hydropower reservoirs in the winter. Our study findings should be applicable to bull trout populations residing in other reservoirs and indicate that entrainment mitigation (for example, use of deterrent devices) should be focused on the fall and winter. This work also provides a framework for combining acoustic telemetry and state-space models to understand and categorize movement behavior of fish in reservoirs and, more generally, in any environment with fluctuating water levels.},

Such displays appear to be motivated by defence of self or the immediately surrounding space rather than defence of territory or resources. Costs and benefits of display versus attack in shark–shark and shark–diver contests are evaluated using payoff matrices and optimal strategies are identified. Shark–human interactions are modelled in terms of a system of nested critical approach distances. For divers faced with a displaying shark, responses which may decrease the likelihood of defensive attack are suggested. Recommendations for future work on shark agonistic behaviour are offered.},

  journal = {Biological Reviews}, 
  abstract = {Reliable estimation of the size or density of wild animal populations is very important for effective wildlife management, conservation and ecology. Currently, the most widely used methods for obtaining such estimates involve either sighting animals from transect lines or some form of capture-recapture on marked or uniquely identifiable individuals. However, many species are difficult to sight, and cannot be easily marked or recaptured. Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density. In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e.g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision. Automated data collection means that surveys can take place at times and in places where it would be too expensive or dangerous to send human observers.
Here, we present an overview of animal density estimation using passive acoustic data, a relatively new and fast-developing field. We review the types of data and methodological approaches currently available to researchers and we provide a framework for acoustics-based density estimation, illustrated with examples from real-world case studies. We mention moving sensor platforms (e.g. towed acoustics), but then focus on methods involving sensors at fixed locations, particularly hydrophones to survey marine mammals, as acoustic-based density estimation research to date has been concentrated in this area. Primary among these are methods based on distance sampling and spatially explicit capture-recapture. The methods are also applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial sound-producing taxa.
We conclude that, despite being in its infancy, density estimation based on passive acoustic data likely will become an important method for surveying a number of diverse taxa, such as sea mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and insects, especially in situations where inferences are required over long periods of time. There is considerable work ahead, with several potentially fruitful research areas, including the development of (i) hardware and software for data acquisition, (ii) efficient, calibrated, automated detection and classification systems, and (iii) statistical approaches optimized for this application. Further, survey design will need to be developed, and research is needed on the acoustic behaviour of target species. Fundamental research on vocalization rates and group sizes, and the relation between these and other factors such as season or behaviour state, is critical. Evaluation of the methods under known density scenarios will be important for empirically validating the approaches presented here.},

Genetic simulation results highlighted three large meta-populations: in the Mediterranean, around the Azores and on the Northeast Atlantic shelf. Demographic results highlighted a finer population structure indicating that several pairs of putative populations might be demographically linked. Results were highly sensitive to dispersal assumptions and relative population abundances, which provided insights into the potential magnitude of genetic and demographic connectivity differences. Accounting for demographic connectivity appears to be crucial for managing and conserving rays and skates while genetic connectivity provides a longer term perspective and less subtle spatial structures. Moreover, accounting for heterogeneity in population abundances is a key factor for determining or interpreting meta-population connectivity.},

Of six tags deployed during June and July, five provided pop‐up locations and two were recovered after c. 4 months.

Surfacing frequency decreased substantially when fish migrated into greater depths of the Bay of Fundy (>40 m). The tidal cycle in Minas Basin had a significant relationship to surfacing frequency, with the most surfacing events (49·5\%) occurring on the flood tide, from mid‐ to high‐tide. Surfacing events ranged from 0–12 a day and the maximum number occurred between 2300 and 0300 hours. Maximum surfacing ascent speeds ranged from 0·50 to 4·17 m s−1 and maximum descent speeds ranged from 0·17 to 3·17 m s−1.

Acoustic monitoring allows long-term tracking of marine animal movement that is traditionally analysed using kernel-based home range estimators.

Network analysis (NA) provides an alternative approach to traditional home range analysis that treats acoustic receivers as network nodes and analyses movement between nodes. To investigate the utility of NA in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using acoustically monitored coastal sharks was conducted. To make direct comparisons with static traditional analysis a temporal scale was not explicitly explored. Comparison of traditional analysis and NA demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50\% kernel utilization distribution (KUD) equivalent), but that NA tended to overestimate general use areas (95\% KUD equivalent) compared to kernel-based methods. Furthermore, frequent bidirectional movements within core use areas were identified by NA, indicating the importance of movement corridors within or between core areas. Movements between acoustic receivers outside core use areas were less frequent and unidirectional suggesting transiting movements. Therefore, NA may be a practical alternative to traditional home range metrics by providing useful data interpretation that allows for a comprehensive picture of animal movement, including identifying core use areas and pathways used.},

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated Pacific cod migratory behavior and site fidelity using passive acoustic telemetry techniques. Acoustic-tagged Pacific cod (n = 111) were monitored by Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays located at the straits and passages connecting PWS with the GOA and arrays deployed in two PWS fjords. Few Pacific cod tagged in PWS moved to the PWS–GOA boundary (1.8\%), indicating that demographic connectivity with the GOA was low. Furthermore, 77\% of tagged cod spent at least 90\% of the time they were known to be alive within small (less than 30 km2) fjords. Cod were present at monitored fjords every month of the study, though some cod migrated away from the fjords during the summer and returned the following winter (11\% in 2015 and 5\% in 2016). Using continuous-time multistate Markov models, we determined that movement behavior was related to fish length. Larger fish tended to emigrate from monitored fjords more often and undergo longer duration migrations.},

This transition to ecosystem-based management (EBM) for the oceans will certainly face a number of hurdles, and many practitioners struggle with how to move forward with EBM. In this paper, we assess whether the necessary science exists to support EBM. Specifically, we evaluate the state of the social and natural sciences for three research areas that are critical to EBM: (1) ecosystem services, (2) cumulative impacts, and (3) ecosystem variability and change. For each of the three research areas, we describe its importance to EBM and assess existing and emerging information and application of this knowledge, focusing on the US West Coast. We conclude that available science is not the bottleneck for moving forward with comprehensive EBM for this region, although we highlight important remaining knowledge gaps, particularly within the social sciences. Given imperfect and uncertain knowledge, EBM calls for an adaptive management approach, starting with readily available information, and continuously adapting as new information emerges. This synthesis can serve as a basis for comparison for other regions; it provides guidance for organizing information in support of EBM and outlines many novel and broadly applicable scientific approaches.},

With high capture and bycatch rates, the abundance of many species is rapidly declining and around a quarter of the world’s sharks and rays are threatened with extinction. At a regional scale this negative trend has also been evidenced in the central Mediterranean Sea, where bottom-trawl fisheries have affected the biomass of certain rays (e.g. Raja clavata) and sharks (e.g. Mustelus spp.). Detailed knowledge of elasmobranch habitat requirements is essential for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, but this is often hampered by a poor understanding of their spatial ecology. Habitat suitability models were used to investigate the habitat preference of nine elasmobranch species and their overall diversity (number of species) in relation to five environmental predictors (i.e. depth, sea surface temperature, surface salinity, slope and rugosity) in the central Mediterranean Sea. Results showed that depth, seafloor morphology and sea surface temperature were the main drivers for elasmobranch habitat suitability. Predictive distribution maps revealed different species-specific patterns of suitable habitat while high assemblage diversity was predicted in deeper offshore waters (400–800 m depth). This study helps to identify priority conservation areas and diversity hot-spots for rare and endangered elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea.},

We first develop a baseline Markov-switching model, which is then extended to incorporate feedback and semi-Markovian components, motivated by the observations made for a particular species, Blainville’s beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). The application of the proposed model to the beaked whale data reveals both strengths and weaknesses of the suggested modeling framework.

  abstract = {Due to global declines, skates and sharks have become a focus of marine conservation in recent years. Despite protective measures, they remain vulnerable to bycatch by fisheries, especially bottom-trawls and pose a problem for fisheries management measures that aim to eliminate discards in the future. In the mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries of the North Atlantic catches can be increased by fitting a length of chain known as a “tickler” in front of the groundgear of the trawl. It was hypothesized that the tickler is especially effective at catching skates and rays that may otherwise escape beneath the net. A trial was undertaken with paired tows with and without the tickler chain. The trial demonstrated that the catch rate of skates and sharks can be significantly lowered by removing the tickler. A set of secondary nets (groundgear bags) attached behind the groundgear of the main net allowed the number of fish escaping under the net to be estimated and showed that the reduction of skates and sharks in the main net was accompanied by an increase in number in the groundgear bags. This suggests that prohibition of the use of tickler chains in areas that are known to be especially important to skates and sharks could have conservation benefits. The removal of the tickler chain had little effect on catch rates of haddock, whiting, and flatfish, but caused a marked decrease in the catch rate of commercially valuable anglerfish.},

This approach introduces unknown bias when receivers are stationed for convenience at geographic bottlenecks (e.g. at the mouth of an embayment or between islands) as opposed to deployments following a statistical sampling design. We evaluated two‐dimensional acoustic receiver arrays (grids: receivers spread uniformly across space) as an alternative approach to provide estimates of survival, movement and habitat use. Performance of variably spaced receiver grids (5–25 km spacing) was evaluated by simulating (1) animal tracks as correlated random walks (speed: 0.1–0.9 m/s; turning angle SD: 5–30°); (2) variable tag transmission intervals along each track (nominal delay: 15–300 s); and (3) probability of detection of each transmission based on logistic detection range curves (mid‐point: 200–1,500 m). From simulations, we quantified (i) time between successive detections on any receiver (detection time), (ii) time between successive detections on different receivers (transit time), and (iii) distance between successive detections on different receivers (transit distance). In the most restrictive detection range scenario (200 m), the 95th percentile of transit time was 3.2 days at 5 km, 5.7 days at 7 km and 15.2 days at 25 km grid spacing; for the 1,500 m detection range scenario, it was 0.1 days at 5 km, 0.5 days at 7 km and 10.8 days at 25 km. These values represented upper bounds on the expected maximum time that an animal could go undetected. Comparison of the simulations with pilot studies on three fishes (walleye Sander vitreus, common carp Cyprinus carpio and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus) from two independent large lake ecosystems (lakes Erie and Winnipeg) revealed shorter detection and transit times than what simulations predicted. By spreading effort uniformly across space, grids can improve understanding of fish migration over the commonly employed receiver line approach, but at increased time cost for maintaining grids.},

The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.},

Empirical standard errors, rather than model-based standard errors, must be used with either GLMMs or GEEs when developing RSFs. There are several important differences between these approaches; in particular, GLMMs are best for producing parameter estimates that predict how management might influence individuals, while GEEs are best for predicting how management might influence populations. As the interpretation, value, and statistical significance of both types of parameter estimates differ, it is important that users select the appropriate analytical method. We also outline the use of k-fold cross validation to assess fit of these models. Both GLMMs and GEEs hold promise for developing RSFs as long as they are used appropriately.},

Conventional tags are defined as those that can be identified visually without the use of special detection equipment. Tagging studies specifically targeting sharks began in the late 1920's, and today numerous cooperative shark tagging programs exist worldwide. Cooperative programs depend on the joint participation of scientists and public volunteers to accomplish research objectives. Benefits and problems of these programs are discussed using the tagging methodologies, protocols, and results of the National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program. An additional 63 shark tagging studies and programs of all types are reviewed. Information useful for behavioral, biological, and fishery management studies can be derived from data resulting from these studies, including species and size composition, sex ratios, spatial and temporal distribution, migrations, movement patterns, rates of travel, delineation of pupping grounds, distribution of maturity intervals, indices of relative abundance, and recognition of individuals. Specific tagging experiments can be designed to provide additional data on age and growth, homing and site fidelity, dispersal rate, residence time, movement rates, tag shedding, and population parameters (e.g. size, mortality, recruitment, exploitation, interaction rates, and stock identity). Sources of bias inherent in tagging and recapture data include mortality, variation in tagging effort and fishing pressure, non-recovery and non-reporting of tags, and tag shedding. Recent advances in tagging methodologies that complement and extend conventional tagging studies will further our knowledge on shark movements and migrations, particularly in the areas of resource utilization and management, space utilization, and population dynamics.},

In this study we investigated habitat use by white sharks in False Bay, South Africa, using acoustic telemetry. 56 sharks (39 female, 17 male), ranging in size from 1.7–5 m TL, were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored on an array of 30 receivers for 975 days. To investigate the effects of season, sex and size on habitat use we used a generalized linear mixed effects model. Tagged sharks were detected in the Bay in all months and across all years, but their use of the Bay varied significantly with the season and the sex of the shark. In autumn and winter males and females aggregated around the Cape fur seal colony at Seal Island, where they fed predominantly on young of the year seals. In spring and summer there was marked sexual segregation, with females frequenting the Inshore areas and males seldom being detected. The shift from the Island in autumn and winter to the Inshore region in spring and summer by females mirrors the seasonal peak in abundance of juvenile seals and of migratory teleost and elasmobranch species respectively. This study provides the first evidence of sexual segregation at a fine spatial scale and demonstrates that sexual segregation in white sharks is not restricted to adults, but is apparent for juveniles and sub-adults too. Overall, the results confirm False Bay as a critical area for white shark conservation as both sexes, across a range of sizes, frequent the Bay on an annual basis. The finding that female sharks aggregate in the Inshore regions when recreational use peaks highlights the need for ongoing shark-human conflict mitigation strategies.},

In this study, we present the findings of a 2.5-year study of white shark occurrence and movement patterns adjacent to the City of Cape Town in False Bay, South Africa, with a focus on spring and summer months. Fifty-one white sharks were monitored annually at three offshore and twelve inshore sites by VR2 acoustic receivers, over 975 days from 1 May 2005 to 31 December 2007. Occurrence patterns at inshore sites during spring and summer were analysed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) with a spatial term (longitude, latitude), time of day and year included as explanatory variables for site use. We found that sharks occurred more frequently at inshore sites along the northern and northwestern shores, compared to the rest of the bay, and they transitioned most frequently between four adjacent beach sites that encompass the most popular recreational water use areas in Cape Town. There was significant diel variation, with higher shark occurrence around midday, and a peak in shark occurrence in 2005, when human-shark interactions also peaked. However, we found no effect of shark size on occurrence patterns at inshore sites. White sharks showed the highest levels of occurrence at specific inshore sites between Muizenberg and Strandfontein beach, and thus inclusion of these sites within False Bay’s marine protected area (MPA) network or recognition as Ecological or Biological Significant Areas (EBSAs) should be a future consideration. These insights into white shark habitat use at inshore sites in False Bay are important for successfully applying the principles of marine spatial planning (MSP) and for making science-based policy decisions. Furthermore, this information can be used to reduce potential shark-human conflict by incorporating it into future shark safety education campaigns.},

To gain insight into species-specific mortality rates, 295 tows were conducted throughout six research cruises (2012–2013 fishing season), with a total of 4216 skates (little skate, Luecoraja erinacea, winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and barndoor skate, Dipturus laevis) evaluated and scored using reflex impairment and injury (i.e., overt physical trauma) indicators. To quantify mortality rates associated with these indicators, 334 skates were retained in an on-deck refrigerated flow-through seawater system and monitored every six-hours until the end of a trial. This study also assessed the effect of fishing conditions/practices and individual traits on post-release mortality. Data suggest that species-specific differences exist wherein winter skate are likely the most resilient (45.4\% mortality) to capture and handling, little skate have a moderate capacity to deal with these pressures (62.7\% mortality), and barndoor skate appear to be the most susceptible (99.9\% mortality). In addition, little and winter skate mortality rates were both influenced by tow duration, while fishing depth and temperature gradient had an effect on little skate and air exposure on winter skate.},

Both species displayed long-term use of MPAs, with some individuals detected for longer than 600days. The mean percentage of time C. amboinensis and C. sorrah spent inside MPAs was 22\% and 32\%, respectively. MPA use varied seasonally, with C. amboinensis spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in summer (mean=28\%) and C. sorrah spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in winter (mean=40\%). Although sharks used large areas inside MPAs, most individuals tended to use only half of the available protected space. In addition, all sharks made excursions from MPAs and individuals exited and re-entered at consistent locations along the MPA boundaries. These results demonstrate that MPAs have conservation benefits for shark populations by providing protection across different species and life stages, and tracking studies can be used to help tailor MPA design to maximize effectiveness.},

  abstract = {An array of acoustic receivers deployed in Cleveland Bay, north Queensland, Australia, passively tracked 20 adult spottail sharks Carcharhinus sorrah over 2 years (2009–2010) to define patterns in movement and habitat use. Individuals were present in the study site for long periods, ranging from 8 to 408 days (mean = 185). Size and location of home ranges did not vary over time. A high level of segregation occurred among C. sorrah, with individuals using different types of habitat and showing strong attachment to specific regions. The depth of habitat individuals used varied between sexes. Males tended to use a narrow range of habitat depths within the study site (2·8–6·0 m), whereas females used shallower habitats (1·4–6·2 m) and displayed a seasonal shift in the depth of habitat used. Mean monthly habitat depth used varied by as much as 2 m for females, with individuals using shallower habitats during the winter months. Long-term presence and consistent home ranges suggest that Cleveland Bay provides important habitat for C. sorrah. By defining patterns in the use of nearshore habitats for C. sorrah, this study improves the understanding of the movement and habitat use of smaller-bodied coastal sharks and may help provide guidance for the management of their populations.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence exists that some marine animals perceive and orient to local distortions in the earth’s main static geomagnetic field. The magnetic fields produced by undersea electric power cables that carry electricity from hydrokinetic energy sources to shore-based power stations may produce similar local distortions in the earth’s main field. Concerns exist that animals migrating along the continental shelves might orient to the magnetic field from the cables, and move either inshore or offshore away from their normal path. We have studied the effect of the Trans Bay Cable (TBC), an 85-km long, high voltage, direct current (DC) transmission line leading underwater from Pittsburg, CA to San Francisco, CA, on fishes migrating through the San Francisco Estuary. These included Chinook salmon smolts (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that migrate downstream through the San Francisco Estuary to the Pacific Ocean and adult green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which migrate upstream from the ocean through the estuary to their spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River and return to the ocean after spawning occurs. Based on a detailed gradiometer survey, we found that the distortions in the earth’s main field produced by bridges across the estuary were much greater than those from the Trans Bay Cable. The former anomalies exceeded the latter by an order of magnitude or more. Significant numbers of tagged Chinook salmon smolts migrated past bridges, which produced strong magnetic anomalies, to the Golden Gate Bridge, where they were recorded by dual arrays of acoustic tag-detecting monitors moored in lines across the mouth of the bay. In addition, adult green sturgeon successfully swam upstream and downstream through the estuary on the way to and from their spawning grounds. Hence, the large anomalies produced by the bridges do not appear to present a strong barrier to the natural seasonal movement patterns of salmonid smolts and adult green sturgeon.},

Unlike on land, it is not known how well protected areas capture marine biodiversity, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of existing MPAs and future protection requirements. We assess the overlap of global MPAs with the ranges of 17,348 marine species (fishes, mammals, invertebrates), and find that 97.4\% of species have <10\% of their ranges represented in stricter conservation classes. Almost all (99.8\%) of the very poorly represented species (<2\% coverage) are found within exclusive economic zones, suggesting an important role for particular nations to better protect biodiversity. Our results offer strategic guidance on where MPAs should be placed to support the CBD’s overall goal to avert biodiversity loss. Achieving this goal is imperative for nature and humanity, as people depend on biodiversity for important and valuable services.},

Due to the difficulties involved in managing adult sharks, focus has been placed on young juvenile and neonate age classes that inhabit discrete inshore nursery areas. However, past confusion over what qualifies as a nursery habitat has led to the identification of vast coastal areas as nurseries, making conservation unfeasible. With the establishment of more discerning criteria for nursery area identification such concerns have been somewhat alleviated, but while effort has been put into defining, identifying, mapping, and in some cases protecting nursery areas, little attention has been paid to the practical value of nurseries for the recovery of exploited shark populations. Often neonate and young juveniles are considered the most critical age classes in terms of population stability/recovery, but evidence is mounting that suggests life stages outside the nursery may be more important in this regard. While nursery area protection should remain a component in shark management strategies it will be critical to link early life stage conservation with management strategies that encompass older individuals residing outside nurseries if effective management is to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986–2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges.},

  journal = {Animal Biotelemetry}, 
  abstract = {When employing acoustic telemetry to study aquatic species, understanding the functional dynamics of the monitoring system is essential for effective study design, data interpretation, and analysis. Typically, researchers are concerned with maximum effective detection range and consequently tend to employ the largest most powerful tags the study species can carry without considerable energetic burden. In ideal acoustic conditions of low ambient noise environments, low attenuation, and reflective structure, higher powered tags can be detected at larger distances from the receiver, but they can also be subject to the phenomenon ‘Close Proximity Detection Interference’ (CPDI). This occurs when reflective barriers, such as a calm water surface and/or hard substrate, result in strong transmission echoes that interfere with the transmission sequence. As a result, transmissions in close proximity to the receiver are not effectively decoded and logged. CPDI was assessed from the results of three detection range tests conducted using the Vemco 69 kHz telemetry system in three contrasting study systems: a sheltered marine Arctic embayment, a temperate freshwater lake, and an exposed marine sub-tropical reef line. For the Arctic embayment, CPDI was absent with the lower power V9 tag (90\% of transmissions received at 55 m) but was recorded for the V13 tag and was most prevalent for the highest power V16 tag (18\% and 8\% of transmissions received at 55 m, respectively). Comparing V16 tag detection profiles between study systems, CPDI was evident in the low ambient noise Arctic embayment and temperate freshwater lake (highest transmission proportions recorded at 370 and 207 m, respectively) but was absent on the high ambient noise sub-tropical reef line. Functional examples highlight the ways in which CPDI can affect different study designs if not acknowledged or accounted for. CPDI was shown to be the most prominent in low ambient noise study systems and should be considered when choosing tag type/power during study design. If unaccounted for, CPDI could lead to misinterpretation during the analysis of acoustic telemetry data. The identification of CPDI highlights the complexities associated with the functionality of acoustic telemetry systems and supports recommendations for thorough detection range testing.},

The importance of sample size and autocorrelation of data in estimating home ranges and animal movements cannot be overemphasized. When considering tradeoffs between sample size and independence, obtaining an adequate sample size is more important than independence between data points. Any analysis of radiotelemetry data must consider the full range of biological and environmental factors that may impact the results. Home range estimation and animal movement analyses must answer difficult questions regarding the internal anatomy of home range boundaries and movement pathways through the judicious use of biological and environmental information. Also, radiotelemetry studies should go beyond simple, general descriptions and use a model-driven approach to examine the key factors determining why and how an animal uses space.},

Vertical behaviour of this fish is unclear as it is often caught by both pelagic and demersal trawls. To gain greater insight into its behaviour, 41 female lumpfish caught during the Icelandic Groundfish Survey (IGFS) in March were tagged with data storage tags (DSTs); the IGFS finishes ∼1 week before the beginning of the lumpfish fishing season (20 March). Data retrieved from returned tags were compared with information on depth and distribution of catches of lumpfish from the IGFS. Thirteen tags were returned with days at liberty ranging from 20 to 61 d. Maximum depth recorded was 308 m (maximum depth of the tag) but based upon interpolation of temperature recordings, one fish may have descended to ∼418 m. Lumpfish displayed a range of vertical behaviours termed demersal, surface, and pelagic. During March, most exhibited either demersal or pelagic behaviour but the time spent in surface behaviour increased from March to April. During demersal behaviour, depth was rarely constant indicating the fish were not stationary. Both DST and catch data from the IGFS indicate that lumpfish exhibit diel patterns in vertical behaviour. As lumpfish frequently exhibit demersal behaviour, the use of the IGFS to monitor changes in abundance is justified. As lumpfish spend a significant amount of time in both the pelagic and demersal zone, they should be considered as a semi-pelagic (or semi-demersal) fish during this life stage/time of year.},

  abstract = {Determining trophic relationships within and among species can provide insight into the structure and function of an ecosystem, and can inform the development of multi-species monitoring and management plans. The goal of this study was to address the need for dietary and trophic information of two common and abundant skates in Prince William Sound (PWS), the Bering skate, Bathyraja interrupta, and longnose skate, Raja rhina. Based on identification and analysis of stomach content data, both species were found to be generalist predators with diets dominated by crustaceans and supplemented with teleosts. The primary source of dietary variability for each species was total length, with spatial variables (i.e., latitude, longitude, and depth) also explaining a large portion of total dietary variability in the Bering skate. However, only a small proportion of the total intraspecific dietary variation was accounted for among the analyzed variables, suggesting substantial individual-based differences in the feeding habits of each species. Trophic level estimates indicated that the Bering skate and longnose skates <100 cm total length (TL) were secondary consumers, whereas longnose skates ≥100 cm TL were more piscivorous, tertiary consumers. Significant interspecific dietary differences were also evident, suggesting trophic separation, likely as a function of skate size. Given their abundance and generalistic feeding behavior, PWS skates can provide a means of monitoring demersal community health; information about their foraging ecology will be valuable in gaining a better understanding of trophodynamics within the PWS food web.},

This study investigated how the behaviour of brown trout, Salmo trutta, inhabiting a stable groundwater-fed, productive and comparatively warm southern English chalk stream differs from that described for other systems, and how this is translated to performance, measured as growth. Physical characteristics were mapped, and high-resolution temperature data collected using a spatial array of data loggers installed throughout the study reach during the winter. A combination of passive integrated transponder and radio telemetry was used to monitor distribution, density, and movement of trout. Micro-archival data storage tags inserted in some individuals provided information on temperature regimes experienced. Growth performance was calculated for recaptured fish. Trout density was positively related to depth and there was no evidence that temperature influenced microhabitat selection. Three patterns of movement were observed. Over three-quarters of tracked fish exhibited high site fidelity and tended to remain in a single focal position throughout the study. Fourteen per cent of trout exploited more than one distinct location, while the remainder were detected at multiple locations and showed no preference for any one. Trout exhibited regular daily activity patterns and highly periodic local movements at dusk and dawn and tended to experience positive growth performance during periods that included winter. This study challenges the conventional view of salmonid winter ecology, which is biased towards populations that inhabit hard rock surface-flow dominated rivers that experience the influence of ice. Despite inhabiting a distinctly different winter habitat template than more commonly studied populations, trout occupying a hydrologically stable and productive chalk stream exhibited behaviours similar to those described for elsewhere, yet performed considerably better.},

  abstract = {Studies of habitat selection and movements often use radio-tracking data for defining animal home ranges. Home ranges (HR) can be approximated by a utilization density distribution (UD) that instead of assuming uniform use of areas within HR boundary provides a probabilistic measure of animal space use. In reality, radio-tracking data contain periods of frequent autocorrelated observations interspersed with temporally more independent observations. Using such temporally irregular data directly may result in biased UD estimates, because areas that have been sampled intensively receive too much weight. The problem of autocorrelation has been tackled by resampling data with an appropriate time interval. However, resampling may cause a large reduction in the data set size along with a loss of information. Evidently, biased UD estimates or reduction in data may prejudice the results on animal habitat selection and movement. We introduce a new method for estimating UDs with temporally irregular data. The proposed method, called the time kernel, accounts for temporal aggregation of observations and gives less weight to temporally autocorrelated observations. A further extension of the method accounts also for spatially aggregated observations with relatively low weights given to observations that are both temporally and spatially aggregated. We test the behaviour of the time kernel method and its spatiotemporal version using simulated data. In addition, the method is applied to a data set of brown bear locations.},

Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis.

  journal = {Ecology}, 
  abstract = {The study of animal movement and behavior is being revolutionized by technology, such as satellite tags and harmonic radar, that allows us to track the movements of individual animals. However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broader-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation techniques, all under a single statistical framework.},

We develop a state–space framework that simultaneously deals with these features and demonstrate our method by analyzing three seal pathway data sets.

These tracking data provide key information about foraging, migratory, and other behaviours that can be linked with bio-physical datasets to understand physiological and ecological influences on habitat selection. In most cases, however, the behavioural context is not directly observable and therefore, must be inferred. Animal movement data are complex in structure, entailing a need for stochastic analysis methods. The recent development of state-space modelling approaches for animal movement data provides statistical rigor for inferring hidden behavioural states, relating these states to bio-physical data, and ultimately for predicting the potential impacts of climate change. Despite the widespread utility, and current popularity, of state-space models for analysis of animal tracking data, these tools are not simple and require considerable care in their use. Here we develop a methodological “road map” for ecologists by reviewing currently available state-space implementations. We discuss appropriate use of state-space methods for location and/or behavioural state estimation from different tracking data types.

Around Orkney, northern Scotland, UK, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population has decreased by 78\% over 20 years. Concern for the declining harbour seal population has led to constraints being placed on tidal energy generation developments. For this study area, telemetry data from 54 animals tagged between 2003 and 2015 were used to produce density estimation maps. Predictive habitat models using GAM-GEEs provided robust predictions in areas where telemetry data were absent, and were combined with density estimation maps, and then scaled to population levels using August terrestrial counts between 2008 and 2015, to produce harbour seal usage maps with confidence intervals around Orkney and the North coast of Scotland. The selected habitat model showed that distance from haul out, proportion of sand in seabed sediment, and annual mean power were important predictors of space use. Fine-scale usage maps can be used in consenting and licensing of anthropogenic developments to determine local abundance. When quantifying commercial impacts through changes to species distributions, usage maps can be spatially explicitly linked to individual-based models to inform predicted movement and behaviour.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark–recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented.

  journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Determining how animals move within their environment is a fundamental knowledge that contributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous ‘round-the-clock’ animal movement data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presence–absence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes. 2. Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animal’s movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance. 3. Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor of movement behaviour. 4. Null modelling of C. perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animal’s movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site. 5. Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.},

Yet despite burgeoning descriptions of these events, many of the proximate and ultimate causes of group living in these top predators remain elusive. Given the documented negative anthropogenic effects on many shark populations globally, there is an increasing need to understand how behaviourally mediated grouping influences population distributions and abundance, and the role this plays in exacerbating vulnerability to fishing mortality. Here, we analyse group living in elasmobranchs: we describe our current understanding of the patterns, mechanisms and functions of both aggregation (where grouping is not driven by social mechanisms) and social grouping (where grouping is influenced by social interaction) and discuss some of the current methods used to study social behaviour in this taxa. In particular, social preferences in elasmobranchs have received relatively little attention. We propose that the study of shark aggregations may benefit from a more fine‐scale analytical approach offered by detailed exploration of social interactions using social network analysis. Better understanding of the frequency and longevity of social relations, in conjunction with current long‐term data on habitat use and site philopatry, will likely serve for a more informed approach to coastal and pelagic elasmobranch conservation initiatives.},

Using controlled and replicated experiments, the role of familiarity as a potential mechanism driving aggregation and social behaviour in this species was considered. Observed S. canicula association data compared to null model simulations of random distributions revealed differences in aggregation under different social contexts. Only familiar juvenile S. canicula aggregated more than would be expected from random distribution across their habitat. Familiarity increased the mean number of groups but did not significantly affect mean group size. Significant preference and avoidance behaviour across all groups were also observed. Furthermore, the strength of social attraction, quantified by the mean association index, was significantly higher in groups containing familiar individuals. Mixed familiar and unfamiliar treatments were also conducted to test for within- and between-group effects, finding high variation across replicates with some groups assorting by familiarity and others not. It is believed that this study is the first to examine experimentally the influence of conspecific familiarity on aggregation behaviour in sharks. These results not only imply a functional benefit to aggregation, but also suggest that persistent social affiliation is likely to influence dispersal following hatching in this small benthic elasmobranch.},

Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of spawning migrations within natal rivers is a critical information gap with regard to habitat protection and ultimately, species recovery. The objectives of this study were to document and describe seasonal movements of shortnose sturgeon in the Altamaha River system, Georgia. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the movements of 40 adult individuals from April 2011 through February 2014. Telemetry data revealed that during much of the year, the adults resided within the tidally influenced portion of the river, with most detections occurring near the freshwater–saltwater interface. Upstream movements to potential spawning habitat occurred during winter and early spring, and most fish returned to the lower estuary by April. Upstream migrations appeared to be triggered by environmental cues and were initiated when mean weekly temperatures in the lower Altamaha River were 11.6–16.9 °C. Unlike spawning migrations documented in northern rivers, the pattern of movement observed in this study was a single‐step migration without an apparent resting or staging period. Upstream migrations during nonspawning months were also observed and appeared to correspond with increasing discharge, which potentially resulted in increased channel navigability and habitat availability in nondrought years. This study further illustrates the clinal variations in life history typical of the species and may have important implications on river‐specific strategies for species recovery.},

  abstract = {1.The iconic European common skate (Dipturus batis) has been described as the first clear case of a fish species brought to the brink of extinction by commercial fishing. Its listing was upgraded to Critically Endangered on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. According to FAO fishery statistics, France is responsible for 60.2\% of the 502 tonnes reported as ‘D. batis’ in the 2005 world landings.2.Noticeable phenotypic differences within the species and inconsistencies in published data on its sexual maturation required careful re-examination of its taxonomy. Morphology, genetics, and life history reveal that two distinct species have been erroneously confused since the 1920s under the single scientific name D. batis. Here it is argued that they should be resurrected as two valid species. The common skate D. batis species-complex is split into two nominal species, the blue skate (provisionally called D. cf. flossada) and the flapper skate (D. cf. intermedia) with maximum lengths of 143.2 cm and 228.8 cm respectively.3.This taxonomic confusion puts into question all previously accumulated data based on D. batis. Its endangered status highlights the need for an extensive reassessment of population collapses with accurately identified species. In 2006/2007 an extensive survey (4110 skates, 14.081 tonnes by weight) was conducted in the main French ports of the D. batis species-complex and relatives (D. oxyrinchus, D. nidarosiensis and Rostroraja alba) that are mixed together in landings under the names ‘D. batis’ and ‘D. oxyrinchus’.4.The survey reveals that official fishery statistics mask species-specific declines, due to the mislabelling of five species under only two landing names. Trends in landings since the 1960s and the life history of these species suggest a dramatic decline and collapse of the spawning stock, preventing the recovery of relict populations.5.The risk of extinction of these depleted species may be higher than previously assessed and might be unavoidable without immediate and incisive conservation action.

This widespread use has been advanced by national and international tracking programs that coordinate deployment of passive acoustic telemetry networks on a regional and continental scale to detect tagged animals. While it is well-known that environmental conditions can affect the performance of acoustic receivers, these effects are rarely quantified despite the profound implications for tag detection and hence the ecological inferences. Here, we deployed eight receivers at different depths within the water column and at different orientations (hydrophone up or down) and 12 tags 200–800 m from the receivers for 234 days to investigate how the tag detection range of acoustic receivers varied through time and under different meteorologic and oceanographic conditions. The study showed that receiver depth and orientation, and time since deployment had the largest effect on the detection range. Thermocline gradient and depth, and wind speed were the environmental factors most affecting detection range, while wind direction, precipitation and atmospheric pressure had negligible or no effect. Comparison of results to a proposed general acoustic theory model and previous studies showed that findings from specific habitat types cannot be generalised and applied across other habitats or environments. A good understanding of the acoustic coverage and temporal variations in relation to environmental conditions are crucial to accurate interpretation of results, and ensuing management recommendations. We recommend that each study include stationary reference tags to measure changes in detection probability with time, help refine detection range, and be used to improve confidence in the reporting and interpretation of the data.},

Yet, very little is known about the movement behavior or habitat use for this species. In this study, movement behavior of juvenile silky sharks was investigated using pop-up satellite archival tags placed on sharks that were captured during chartered research cruises on a commercial tuna purse seine fishing vessel using drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in the western and central Pacific Ocean and on sharks captured using pelagic longlines in the eastern tropical Pacific. Analysis of horizontal and vertical movement behavior revealed silky sharks spend nearly 100\% of their time in the shallow, warm waters of the mixed layer. Juvenile silky shark depth and thermal preferences overlapped with the preferred habitat of the primary target tuna species, indicating vulnerability to capture in purse seine and shallow-set longline fisheries throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean where temperatures range between 24 and 29 °C. Reconstruction of horizontal movements showed dispersal between adjacent national jurisdictions and international waters, highlighting the need for international collaborations in the implementation of conservation measures.},

These three types were defined as shallow, intermediate, and deep and represented 24.4\%, 18.8\%, and 56.8\% of the total number of days in the study, respectively. More shallow and intermediate dive-type behavior was found in the first half of the year, and in latitudes from 14°N to 16°N and north of 28°N. A greater amount of deep-dive behavior was found in the regions south of 10°N and between 18°N and 28°N during the third and fourth quarters of the year. Dive-type behavior also varied with oceanographic conditions, with more shallow and intermediate behavior found in colder surface waters. Intermediate and deep-dive types were pooled to reflect the depths where bigeye tuna may have potential interactions with fishing gear. A Generalized Additive Model was used to quantify the effects of time, space, and sea surface temperature on this pooled dive type. Results from the model showed that while latitude and quarter of the year were important parameters, sea surface temperature had the most significant effect on the pooled intermediate and deep-dive behavior. Model predictions indicated that the largest percentage of potential interaction would occur in the fourth quarter in the region from 18°N–20°N, which corresponds to the time and place of the highest bigeye tuna catch rates by the Hawaii-based long-line fishery. These results suggest that a model framework using these three predictive variables may be useful in identifying areas of potentially high bigeye tuna catch rates.},

There were considerable and volatile changes in detections throughout all trials. Increased water movement and temperature significantly reduced detection rates, whereas daytime and full-moon periods had significantly higher detection rates. All nine transmitters (from seven transmitter types tested) showed a sigmoidal trend between detection frequency and distance. Higher-powered transmitters had a prolonged detection distance with near-maximal detections, whereas lower-powered transmitters showed an almost immediate decline. Variation of detection frequency, transmitter type and the modelled relationship between distance and detection frequency were incorporated into a positioning trial which resulted in markedly improved position estimates over previous techniques.},

Traditional approaches for choosing among home range models have not resulted in general, consistent, and unambiguous criteria that can be applied to individual data sets. We present a new application of information-theoretic model selection that overcomes many of the limitations of traditional approaches, as follows. (1) It alleviates the need to know the true home range to assess home range models, thus allowing performance to be evaluated with data on individual animals. (2) The best model can be chosen from a set of candidate models with the proper balance between fit and complexity. (3) If candidate home range models are based on underlying ecological processes, researchers can use the selected model not only to describe the home range, but also to infer the importance of various ecological processes affecting animal movements within the home range.},

At the individual level, physiological processes such as energetics are critical in understanding biomechanics and movement ecology and also scale up to influence food webs and trophic cascades. Although vital rates and population‐level characteristics are tied with individual‐level animal movement, most statistical models for telemetry data are not equipped to provide inference about these relationships because they lack the explicit, mechanistic connection to physiological dynamics. We present a framework for modelling telemetry data that explicitly includes an aggregated physiological process associated with decision making and movement in heterogeneous environments. Our framework accommodates a wide range of movement and physiological process specifications. We illustrate a specific model formulation in continuous‐time to provide direct inference about gains and losses associated with physiological processes based on movement. Our approach can also be extended to accommodate auxiliary data when available. We demonstrate our model to infer mountain lion (Puma concolor; in Colorado, USA) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer; in Kruger National Park, South Africa) recharge dynamics.},

Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34\% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

However, observation gaps and missing records are unavoidable because the focal individual can move out of sight and recording devices do not always work properly. Using an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, we have developed a novel gap‐filling method to predict the most likely route that an animal would have traveled; within this framework, an algorithm learns a reward function from animal trajectories to find the environmental features preferred by the animal. We applied this approach to GPS trajectories obtained from streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) and provide evidence of the advantages of the IRL approach over previously used interpolation methods. These advantages are as follows: (1) No assumptions about the parametric distribution governing movements are needed, (2) no assumptions regarding landscape preferences and restrictions are needed, and (3) large spatiotemporal gaps can be filled. This work demonstrates how IRL can enhance the ability to fill gaps in animal trajectories and construct reward‐space maps in heterogeneous environments. The proposed methodology can assist movement research, which seeks to understand phenomena that are ecologically and evolutionarily significant, such as habitat selection and migration.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of an animal’s behavior during particular life history stages can provide insights into habitat selection, and this can have important conservation implications. Gravid hawksbill turtles spend the internesting interval resting on the seafloor, but their diving behavior has only been previously examined in shallow-water habitats. We examined depth use of gravid hawksbills in a location of variable bathymetry to determine if hawksbills engage in deeper diving if deeper waters are available. We attached archival time-depth recorders onto hawksbills nesting at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, where the neritic zone ends within 500 m of the shoreline. We recorded seven internesting intervals from five individuals. Internesting intervals were characterized by long dives (mean 24.2 ± SD 22.3 min) to a constant depth, consistent with seafloor resting in a spatially restricted residence area. There was little variation in the water temperatures at all depths occupied (mean 29.06 ± SD 0.43 °C). Two turtles attained the deepest recorded dives for gravid hawksbills (95.1 and 84.4 m) and sometimes remained at depths greater than 60 m for up to 30 min. Although we recorded instances of relatively deep diving for the species, the overall pattern of seafloor resting and infrequent diving was consistent with hawksbills in other ocean basins with different offshore habitats. We propose that benthic resting is common behavior for gravid hawksbills globally, and protection of benthic habitats near the nesting beach should be a management priority.},

However, core areas shifted within the study site over time resulting in eventual usage of most of the available habitat. Gillnet sampling revealed that S. tiburo were abundant in shallow water near seagrass beds, but that presence of individuals at specific sites was variable. Tag-recapture data showed that most individuals remained within the Pine Island Sound region over time and did not appear to undergo long coastal migrations.

  abstract = {The current rate of shark global exploitation and mortality is arguably so high under current management regimes that unless a renewed initiative is undertaken some species of shark will become effectively extinct. Current efforts to sustainably manage shark mortality are driven primarily by domestic laws in a few countries, big international non-governmental organizations (BINGOs) promoting environmental laws in the countries or regions where they exist, a handful of regional fisheries management organizations (e.g., IATTC and ICCAT), and inter-governmental organizations such as CITES. The absence of enforcement capability is often argued as the critical component in the failure to protect sharks from overexploitation. The remedy advanced here goes far beyond the need for stepped up enforcement, and calls for the creation of an entirely new international management regime, the International Commission for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (ICCMS). Such an agency could learn from the experiences of management bodies tasked with conservation of species biologically similar to sharks, such as the International Whaling Commission (IWC), to improve its efficacy. Critics have identified many organizational flaws that reduced the IWC’s effectiveness during its earliest years. Some of those flaws are examined here and remedies are suggested that an ICCMS could use to create a more effective management regime. The life histories of elasmobranches and large whales are compared to illustrate their similarities as a biological foundation for the selection of the IWC as a model.},

  abstract = {Most processes within organisms, and most interactions between organisms and their environment, have distinct time profiles. The temporal coordination of such processes is crucial across levels of biological organization, but disciplines differ widely in their approaches to study timing. Such differences are accentuated between ecologists, who are centrally concerned with a holistic view of an organism in relation to its external environment, and chronobiologists, who emphasize internal timekeeping within an organism and the mechanisms of its adjustment to the environment. We argue that ecological and chronobiological perspectives are complementary, and that studies at the intersection will enable both fields to jointly overcome obstacles that currently hinder progress. However, to achieve this integration, we first have to cross some conceptual barriers, clarifying prohibitively inaccessible terminologies. We critically assess main assumptions and concepts in either field, as well as their common interests. Both approaches intersect in their need to understand the extent and regulation of temporal plasticity, and in the concept of ‘chronotype’, i.e. the characteristic temporal properties of individuals which are the targets of natural and sexual selection. We then highlight promising developments, point out open questions, acknowledge difficulties and propose directions for further integration of ecological and chronobiological perspectives through Wild Clock research. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild Clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

  abstract = {Understanding the foraging behavior and spatial distribution of top predators is crucial to gaining a complete understanding of communities. However, studies of top predators are often logistically difficult and it is important to develop appropriate methods for identifying factors influencing their spatial distribution. Sharks are top predators in many marine communities, yet no studies have quantified the habitat use of large predatory sharks or determined the factors that might influence shark spatial distributions. We used acoustic telemetry and animal-borne video cameras ("Crittercam") to test the hypothesis that tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) habitat use is determined by the availability of their prey. We also used Crittercam to conduct the first investigation of foraging behavior of tiger sharks. To test for habitat preferences of sharks, the observed proportion of time in each habitat for each individual was compared to the predicted values for that individual based on correlated random walk and track randomization methods. Although there was individual variation in habitat use, tiger sharks preferred shallow seagrass habitats, where their prey is most abundant. Despite multiple encounters with potential prey, sharks rarely engaged in prolonged high-speed chases, and did not attack prey that were vigilant. We propose that the tiger sharks' foraging tactic is one of stealth, and sharks rely upon close approaches to prey in order to be successful. This study shows that using appropriate analysis techniques and a variety of field methods it is possible to elucidate the factors influencing habitat use and gain insights into the foraging behavior of elusive top predators.},

Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.},

  abstract = {Tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier are important predators in a variety of nearshore communities, including the seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Because tiger sharks are known to influence spatial distributions of multiple prey species, it is important to understand how they use habitats at a variety of spatial scales. We used a combination of catch rates and acoustic tracking to determine tiger shark microhabitat use in Shark Bay.2Comparing habitat-use data from tracking against the null hypothesis of no habitat preference is hindered in Shark Bay, as elsewhere, by the difficulty of defining expected habitat use given random movement. We used randomization procedures to generate expected habitat use in the absence of habitat preference and expected habitat use differences among groups (e.g. males and females). We tested the performance of these protocols using simulated data sets with known habitat preferences.3The technique correctly classified sets of simulated tracks as displaying a preference or not and was a conservative test for differences in habitat preferences between subgroups of tracks (e.g. males vs. females).4Sharks preferred shallow habitats over deep ones, and preferred shallow edge microhabitats over shallow interior ones. The use of shallow edges likely increases encounter rates with potential prey and may have profound consequences for the dynamics of Shark Bay's seagrass ecosystem through indirect effects transmitted by grazers that are common prey of tiger sharks.5Females showed a greater tendency to use shallow edge microhabitats than did males; this pattern was not detected by traditional analysis techniques.6The randomization procedures presented here are applicable to many field studies that use tracking by allowing researchers both to determine overall habitat preferences and to identify differences in habitat use between groups within their sample.},

  abstract = {Early warning systems of extinction thresholds have been developed for and tested in microcosm experiments, but have not been applied to populations of wild animals. We used state–space population models and a statistical indicator to detect a transcritical bifurcation extinction threshold in a population of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) located in an agricultural region experiencing habitat deterioration and loss. The extinction threshold was detectible using two independent data sets. We compared predictions from state–space population models to predictions from a statistical indicator and found that predictions were corroborated. Using state–space population models, we estimated that our study population crossed the extinction threshold in 2010 (2002–2036; 95 \% confidence intervals [CI]) using the whistle count (WC) data set and in 2008 (1999–2064; 95 \% CI) using the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. With the statistical indicator, we estimated that the extinction threshold will be crossed in 2018 (2004–2031; 95 \% CI) using the WC data and will be crossed in 2012 (2006–2018; 95 \% CI) using the BBS data. We expect extinction in our study population soon after crossing the extinction threshold, but the time to extinction and potential reversibility of the threshold are unknown. Our results suggest that neither small nor decreasing population size will warn of the transcritical bifurcation extinction threshold. We suggest that managers of wildlife populations in regions experiencing land use change should try to predict extinction thresholds and make management decisions to ensure the persistence of the species.},

Additionally the return rate and growth of individuals tagged with PSATs was compared with those of small acoustic tags and DSTs. Overall, the depth distribution of individuals tagged with PSATs was similar to that of those tagged with DSTs, reflecting the pelagic nature of S. salar at sea. Individuals tagged with PSATs, however, dived less frequently and to shallower depths, and dived and surfaced at slower velocities. Sea surface temperatures experienced by individuals tagged with PSATs were similar to those experienced by those tagged with DSTs for the same time of year, suggesting that there were no large differences in the ocean migration. Return rates did not depend on whether individuals were tagged with PSATs or not, indicating that survival at sea was not impacted by PSATs in comparison to small internal tags. Individuals tagged with PSATs, however, had a smaller increase in body mass than those tagged with acoustic tags or DSTs. It was concluded that PSATs are suitable for use in researching large-scale migratory behaviour of adult S. salar at sea, but that some effects on their behaviour from tagging must be expected. Effects of PSATs may be largest in the short term when S. salar are swimming in bursts at high speeds. Even though individuals tagged with PSATs performed deep and frequent dives, the results of this study suggest that untagged individuals would perform even deeper and more frequent dives than tagged individuals.},

Sections of similar depth distribution, identified using a split moving window analysis, were investigated in relation to the thermal structure of the water column and activity rates. Minimum horizontal displacement of between 66 and 5,187 km for blue sharks and 16 km for the thresher shark were recorded over 863 tracking days. Maximum depths ranged from 540 to 807 m for blue sharks and 144 m for the thresher shark. All sharks displayed plasticity in their depth distribution, with diel vertical movements and surface‐oriented movements the two most common patterns. Diel movement of prey is the most likely explanation for diel vertical movements of thresher and blue sharks.

  abstract = {Advances in acoustic telemetry technology have led to an improved understanding of the spatial ecology of many freshwater and marine fish species. Understanding the performance of acoustic receivers is necessary to distinguish between tagged fish that may have been present but not detected and from those fish that were absent from the area. In this study, two stationary acoustic transmitters were deployed 250 m apart within each of four acoustic receiver lines each containing at least 10 receivers (i.e., eight acoustic transmitters) located in Saginaw Bay and central Lake Huron for nearly 2 years to determine whether the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission varied as a function of time (i.e., season), location, and distance between acoustic transmitter and receiver. Distances between acoustic transmitters and receivers ranged from 200 m to >10 km in each line. The daily observed probability of detecting an acoustic transmission was used in simulation models to estimate the probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a line of receivers. The probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter on a receiver 1000 m away differed by month for different receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay but was similar for paired acoustic transmitters deployed 250 m apart within the same line. Mean probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter at 1000 m calculated over the study period varied among acoustic transmitters 250 m apart within a line and differed among receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. The simulated probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a receiver line was characterized by short periods of time with decreased detection. Although increased receiver spacing and higher fish movement rates decreased simulated detection probability, the location of the simulated receiver line in Lake Huron had the strongest effect on simulated detection probability. Performance of receiver lines in Lake Huron varied across a range of spatiotemporal scales and was inconsistent among receiver lines. Our simulations indicated that if 69 kHz acoustic transmitters operating at 158 dB in 10–30 m of freshwater were being used, then receivers should be placed 1000 m apart to ensure that all fish moving at 1 m s−1 or less will be detected 90\% of days over a 2-year period. Whereas these results can be used as general guidelines for designing new studies, the irregular variation in acoustic transmitter detection probabilities we observed among receiver line locations in Lake Huron makes designing receiver lines in similar systems challenging and emphasizes the need to conduct post hoc analyses of acoustic transmitter detection probabilities.},

The Chukchi Ecosystem Observatory (CEO) described here uses new sensor technologies to meet needs for continuous, high-resolution, and year-round observations across all levels of the ecosystem in the biologically productive and seasonally ice-covered Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska. This mooring array records a broad suite of variables that facilitate observations, yielding better understanding of physical, chemical, and biological couplings, phenologies, and the overall state of this Arctic shelf marine ecosystem. While cold temperatures and 8 months of sea ice cover present challenging conditions for the operation of the CEO, this extreme environment also serves as a rigorous test bed for innovative ecosystem monitoring strategies. Here, we present data from the 2015–2016 CEO deployments that provide new perspectives on the seasonal evolution of sea ice, water column structure, and physical properties, annual cycles in nitrate, dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton blooms, and export, zooplankton abundance and vertical migration, the occurrence of Arctic cod, and vocalizations of marine mammals such as bearded seals. These integrated ecosystem observations are being combined with ship-based observations and modeling to produce a time series that documents biological community responses to changing seasonal sea ice and water temperatures while establishing a scientific basis for ecosystem management.</p>},

  journal = {Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology}, 
  abstract = {Previous studies have found that predators utilise habitat corridors to ambush prey moving through them. In the marine environment, coastal channels effectively act as habitat corridors for prey movements, and sightings of predators in such areas suggest that they may target these for foraging. Unlike terrestrial systems where the underlying habitat structure is generally static, corridors in marine systems are in episodic flux due to water movements created by tidal processes. Although these hydrographic features can be highly complex, there is generally a predictable underlying cyclic tidal pattern to their structure. For marine predators that must find prey that is often patchy and widely distributed, the underlying temporal predictability in potential foraging opportunities in marine corridors may be important drivers in their use. Here, we used data from land-based sightings and 19 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with high-resolution GPS telemetry to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of seals in a narrow tidal channel. These seals showed a striking pattern in their distribution; all seals spent a high proportion of their time around the narrowest point of the channel. There was also a distinctive tidal pattern in the use of the channel; sightings of seals in the water peaked during the flood tide and were at a minimum during the ebb tide. This pattern is likely to be related to prey availability and/or foraging efficiency driven by the underlying tidal pattern in the water movements through the channel. To maximise foraging efficiency, predators often make use of narrow constrictions in habitat to intercept prey using these corridors for movement. In the marine environment, narrow channels may act as corridors, and sightings of predators suggest that they may target these for foraging. Despite this, there is little information on how individual predators use such areas. Here, we investigate how individual harbour seals use a narrow coastal channel subject to strong tidal currents; results showed that seals spent the majority of their time at the narrowest point of the channel foraging during peak tidal currents. This highlights the importance of narrow channels for marine predators and suggests that this usually wide-ranging predator may restrict its geographic range to forage in the channel as a result of increased prey availability and/or foraging efficiency driven by water movements through the narrow corridor.},

Salt secretions of the rectal gland and excretions in the urine compensate for continuous inward diffusion of environmental salts. Freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs in fresh water synthesise less urea and retain less urea and other body fluid solutes compared to marine elasmobranchs and thus have relatively lower osmolarity. Electrolyte uptake at the gills and kidney reabsorption of salts maintain acid–base balance and ionic consistency. The role of the gills, kidney, liver and rectal gland in elasmobranch osmoregulation is reviewed. The ontogeny of osmoregulatory systems in elasmobranchs and the contribution of drinking and eating processes in maintaining osmotic consistency are discussed.

  journal = {Animal Behaviour}, 
  abstract = {In aquatic organisms, diel vertical migration (DVM) is typically characterized as ascent at dusk and decent at dawn. Often several hypotheses are required to explain the sensory-mechanisms and ultimate causes of DVM. Currently, most of the research focused at the individual level has identified DVM functions as a response to light, feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics in small planktivores. However, there are no studies examining whether DVM hypotheses can explain and predict individual behavioural characteristics in top-level predators. In this study, we test whether bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, a cold-water pelagic-cruising piscivore, show size-dependent daily and seasonal patterns in DVM consistent with light levels (proximate trigger) and feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics hypotheses. To test these hypotheses, free-swimming bull trout (N =187, 358–881mm total length) in a large, temperate reservoir were implanted with depth-sensing acoustic transmitters for 1year. We found that swimming depths of bull trout were shallowest at night, deepest during the day and showed clear patterns of DVM across all seasons. In line with the predator avoidance hypothesis, large and small bull trout occupied different depths in all seasons except the spring, while the likelihood of depth change for large and small fish varied depending on season and diel period. The greatest depth difference among large and small bull trout occurred in the summer and less so in autumn. In the summer, small bull trout remained at greater depths (∼15m) than larger fish (∼7m) regardless of diel period. Our results indicate that light is a proximate trigger, and since there is no clear temperature-related bioenergetic advantage to changing depths during winter, feeding opportunities and predator avoidance are the most parsimonious DVM hypotheses to explain body-size-dependent behaviour in this top-level predator.},

  author = {Guinot, Guillaume and Cavin, Lionel}, 
  journal = {Biological Reviews}, 
  abstract = {Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates and rays) represent more than half of today's vertebrate taxic diversity (approximately 33000 species) and form the largest component of vertebrate diversity in extant aquatic ecosystems. Yet, patterns of ‘fish’ evolutionary history remain insufficiently understood and previous studies generally treated each group independently mainly because of their contrasting fossil record composition and corresponding sampling strategies. Because direct reading of palaeodiversity curves is affected by several biases affecting the fossil record, analytical approaches are needed to correct for these biases. In this review, we propose a comprehensive analysis based on comparison of large data sets related to competing phylogenies (including all Recent and fossil taxa) and the fossil record for both groups during the Mesozoic–Cainozoic interval. This approach provides information on the ‘fish’ fossil record quality and on the corrected ‘fish’ deep-time phylogenetic palaeodiversity signals, with special emphasis on diversification events. Because taxonomic information is preserved after analytical treatment, identified palaeodiversity events are considered both quantitatively and qualitatively and put within corresponding palaeoenvironmental and biological settings. Results indicate a better fossil record quality for elasmobranchs due to their microfossil-like fossil distribution and their very low diversity in freshwater systems, whereas freshwater actinopterygians are diverse in this realm with lower preservation potential. Several important diversification events are identified at familial and generic levels for elasmobranchs, and marine and freshwater actinopterygians, namely in the Early–Middle Jurassic (elasmobranchs), Late Jurassic (actinopterygians), Early Cretaceous (elasmobranchs, freshwater actinopterygians), Cenomanian (all groups) and the Paleocene–Eocene interval (all groups), the latter two representing the two most exceptional radiations among vertebrates. For each of these events along with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, we provide an in-depth review of the taxa involved and factors that may have influenced the diversity patterns observed. Among these, palaeotemperatures, sea-levels, ocean circulation and productivity as well as continent fragmentation and environment heterogeneity (reef environments) are parameters that largely impacted on ‘fish’ evolutionary history, along with other biotic constraints.},

  journal = {Global Change Biology}, 
  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is currently experiencing major environmental changes, including in sea‐ice cover. Such changes strongly influence ecosystem structure and functioning and affect the survival and reproduction of predators such as seabirds. These effects are likely mediated by reduced availability of food resources. As such, seabirds are reliable eco‐indicators of environmental conditions in the Antarctic region. Here, based on 9 years of sea‐ice data, we found that the breeding success of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) reaches a peak at intermediate sea‐ice cover (ca. 20\%). We further examined the effects of sea‐ice conditions on the foraging activity of penguins, measured at multiple scales from individual dives to foraging trips. Analysis of temporal organisation of dives, including fractal and bout analyses, revealed an increasingly consistent behaviour during years with extensive sea‐ice cover. The relationship between several dive parameters and sea‐ice cover in the foraging area appears to be quadratic. In years of low and high sea‐ice cover, individuals adjusted their diving effort by generally diving deeper, more frequently and by resting at the surface between dives for shorter periods of time than in years with intermediate sea‐ice cover. Our study therefore suggests that sea‐ice cover is likely to affect the reproductive performance of Adélie penguins through its effects on foraging behaviour, as breeding success and most diving parameters share a common optimum. Some years, however, deviated from this general trend, suggesting that other factors (e.g. precipitation during the breeding season) might sometimes become preponderant over the sea‐ice effects on breeding and foraging performance. Our study highlights the value of monitoring fitness parameters and individual behaviour concomitantly over the long‐term to better characterize optimal environmental conditions and potential resilience of wildlife. Such an approach is crucial if we want to anticipate the effects of environmental change on Antarctic penguin populations. In the region around the Dumont d'Urville research station in Antarcica, when sea ice covers approximately 20\% of the Adélie penguins’ foraging area, we found that breeding success reaches a peak, and that most diving parameters reach an optimum for similar sea‐ice conditions, suggesting that sea ice affects the reproductive performance of Adélie penguins through its effects on diving activity.},

It is recognized that adult and juvenile movement reduces the core benefits of protected areas, namely protecting the full age–structure of marine populations, while at the same time perhaps improving fisheries yield over the no-reserve situation through export of individuals from protected areas. Nevertheless, the study of the consequences of movement on protected area functioning is unbalanced. Significant attention has been paid to the influence of certain movement patterns, such as diffusive movement and home ranges, while the impacts of others, such as density-dependent movements and ontogenetic migrations, have been relatively ignored. Here we review the diversity of density-independent and density-dependent movement patterns, as well as what is currently known about their consequences for the conservation and fisheries effects of marine protected areas. We highlight a number of ‘partially addressed’ issues in marine protected area research, such as the effects of reserves targeting specific life phases, and a number of essentially unstudied issues, such as density-dependent movements, nomadism, ontogenetic migrations, behavioral polymorphism and ‘dynamic’ reserves that adjust location as a realtime response to habitat changes. Assessing these issues will be essential to creating effective marine protected area networks for mobile species and accurately assessing reserve impacts on these species.},

Here we report the discovery of cryptic species in common skate collected from the northeast Atlantic continental shelf. Data from nuclear microsatellite markers indicated two clearly distinct clades and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences demonstrated monophyly of each one of them. Capture locations showed evidence of strong spatial segregation, with one taxon occurring mainly in waters off the southern British Isles and around Rockall, while the other was restricted to more northerly shelf waters. These apparently cryptic species showed overlapping substrate and depth preferences, but distributional limits were closely related to temperature gradients, potentially indicating thermal limits to their distributions.

This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

To prevent bat ray predation on cultured oyster beds, much effort has focused on reducing their population. A 13 month study was conducted in Humboldt Bay to examine the rays' use of the bay, population structure, and feeding ecology. Bat rays are seasonally found in Humboldt Bay during the spring, summer, and early fall months. Adult rays were most abundant during the summer months, while numbers of juveniles increased through the summer and early fall, indicating that Humboldt Bay is an important pupping and nursery ground. Very few rays were found in the bay during the colder months of the year. This decline in abundance is attributed to cooler water temperatures (< 10° C). The stomach contents from 503 bat rays were examined. Overall, clams were the predominant prey item. The index of importance and Shannon-Weiner diversity index indicated that food habits of bat rays change with increasing size. Larger prey items and a wider variety of prey items were consumed as rays increased in size. Dietary importance of small clams and Crangon shrimp decreased with increasing ray size, while the importance of larger prey items (e.g. large clams, Cancer crabs, blue mud shrimp, echiuran worms) increased. Predation on oysters was rare. Differences between the diets of male and female rays of similar sizes were also observed.},

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N = 86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. A total of 0\%, 17.9\% and 34.7\% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Expansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100\% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.},

Sixty-one articles addressing home range, home range overlap, daily net displacement (straight-line distance between two locations on consecutive days), and/or distance of dispersal of the three species were included. Meta-analysis, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and beta regression tests were run to analyse differences among species and sexes and to elucidate the influence of other variables, such as latitude and ecoregion, on spatial behaviour. Pumas had on average larger home ranges (mean ± SE: 281.87 ± 35.76 km2) than jaguars (128.61 ± 49.5 km2) and ocelots (12.46 ± 3.39 km2). Intersexual range overlap was higher than intrasexual range overlap in jaguars and pumas. Sex affected the home range size of all three species, but only influenced daily net displacement in ocelots. Ecoregion affected the home range size of all three species but did not significantly affect either the daily net displacement or the dispersal distance of pumas. Latitude affected the home range size of jaguars and pumas. It did not affect daily net displacement or dispersal distance in jaguars and pumas, but did affect daily net displacement in ocelots. Although there was a lack of studies in most countries for the three species, information was particularly lacking in the Neotropics for jaguars and pumas and in North America for ocelots. Researchers usually presented low sample sizes and used different methods to examine the ecological issues considered here.

Rapid movements of up to 250m within 2h interval were recorded sporadically. During restricted periods some of the fish did move vertically with a distinct diel rhythm. Calculations of the time needed to equalise the pressure to remain at a constant buoyant state indicated that the fish probably were negatively buoyant most of the time. However, the direct effect of the vertical movements on the acoustical target strength could not be quantified. Seasonal differences in mean depth and ambient temperature were observed.

The influence of environmental factors on the hourly detection rate was evaluated using environmental data from a nearby climate station. The signal detection probability was modelled within the framework of general theory of sound propagation in water.Wind was found to have the strongest influence on the detection rate. Transmitter depth range and rain also contributed significantly to the variation in detection rate.By modelling the attenuation coefficient as a function of wind speed, we show that the probability of detecting a free-swimming acoustically tagged animal can be successfully modelled using general sound propagation theory.The approach of modelling detection probability as a function of the attenuation coefficient offers a wide applicability, as it implies a direct link between detection probability and physical characteristics of the water at the study site. Correcting for varying detection probability is in many cases extremely important to do, since rhythms in biological/behavioural factors are often confounded with environmental variables that influence detection probability (e.g. sea breeze, tide).},

  abstract = {Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).},

 provide, many animals undertake regular vertical and/or horizontal migratory movements in synchrony with the
 tidal cycle. Others use tidal currents selectively for transport to new habitats. Such movements vary in extent from a
 few mm to several km and may be modulated by the diel cycle of light intensity. This paper reviews the existence of
 tidal migration in marine animals from various taxa and habitats. Crustacean and sh examples illustrate the various
 functions of tidal migration, including transport, feeding, predator avoidance and reproduction. These functions are
 not necessarily mutually exclusive and may change throughout ontogeny. The mechanisms involved in migration

  abstract = {Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: “fixed sphere-of-influence,” or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an “adaptive sphere-of-influence,” or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original “fixed-number-of-points,” or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu).},

  journal = {Ecology of Freshwater Fish}, 
  abstract = {Data sets with increased spatial and temporal resolution can help researchers and resource managers quantify representative distributional patterns of mobile sportfish. In this research, first, we illustrate patterns of sportfish distribution using individual (percent of population, residence time, number of movements) and combined distributional metrics. Second, we apply these metrics to one highly mobile fish species, the blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), across a range of spatial (whole reservoir, region, site) and temporal (year, month, diel period) scales. Specifically, we tracked 123 acoustically tagged blue catfish with a 20‐receiver array in Milford Reservoir, KS, USA. When we integrated metrics, four site‐specific distributional patterns emerged: (a) a large, active multi‐site fish aggregation, (b) localised site fidelity, (c) transitional sites and (d) rarely used locations. These patterns would not have been detected using a single metric as each measurement revealed a different piece of the distribution story. For example, if we had only quantified percent of population, we could identify fish location, but not whether individual fish spent time at a location or were just passing through. Our examination of multiple scales also provided a novel context for interpreting site‐specific patterns. As an illustration of this insight, using conventional approaches, we would have observed heterogeneity, but we would not have detected fish aggregations, in which individual fish either remained or repeatedly returned to a site. In summary, our results show the advantage of setting the entire ecosystem as the study boundary to integrate multiple responses using a spatially and temporally extensive data set.},

  abstract = {Acoustic tracking is a commonly used method to study the movement ecology of marine species. The characteristics of the data collected are not simply functions of the location of the tagged animal as they are also influenced by the method of data collection and its sampling frequency. In particular, since the data are acoustically driven, the significance of any result hinges not only on the accuracy of the equipment but also on the reliability of the information received. While passive acoustic telemetry requires an evaluation of the detection efficiency of receivers moored in different habitats (or sites) to obtain reliable data, active acoustic telemetry requires more field-related information on how to best track tagged animals without impacting on their natural behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of active acoustic telemetry data in a temperate coastal environment. This was achieved by conducting a series of field experiments to assess (i) the use of signal strength-to-infer distance to the tracked animal under different tracking conditions, (ii) what signal strength threshold can be used to obtain reliable bio-telemetered data, (iii) whether the behaviour of a tracked animal would be a main concern in terms of data reliability, and (iv) the best filtering option to reduce the data to be analysed. The findings yielded a signal strength-to-distance relationship to improve the accuracy of the positional fixes of actively tracked animals, which can be used as a practical reference for future tracking studies on pelagic species in temperate coastal environments.},

  author = {Gedamke, Todd and Hoenig, John M. and DuPaul, William D. and Musick, John A.}, 
  journal = {North American Journal of Fisheries Management}, 
  abstract = {In 1998, the barndoor skate Dipturus laevis was reported to have been locally extirpated in parts of its northern range and to be potentially on the brink of extinction. Managers were faced with assessing the species with virtually no information other than a limited number of individuals observed in annual groundfish surveys. Since that time, a number of the primary life history parameters have been estimated, but the population dynamics of the species remain largely unexplored. In this study, we use information from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) annual groundfish surveys to investigate two critical components of barndoor skate population dynamics: the relationship of recruitment to spawner abundance and the maximum population growth rate. A strong stock–recruitment relationship was found in the fall survey data, suggesting that recruitment is closely tied to spawner abundance. The Ricker and Beverton–Holt stock–recruit models were fitted to the survey data, and estimates of the slope at the origin was generated. These parameters provided an estimate of the maximum annual reproductive rate, which was then converted to an estimate of the instantaneous maximum population growth rate of 0.37–0.38 per year. A second analysis was also conducted using a Leslie matrix and data from the NMFS survey. Observed rates of population change were used to estimate early life history parameters and incorporate density dependence into the density‐independent framework of a Leslie matrix demographic model. From this method, the instantaneous maximum population growth for the barndoor skate was estimated to be 0.36–0.48 per year. Our results suggest that the species is more resilient to fishing pressure than previously believed and is capable of growing at an instantaneous rate in excess of 35\% at low population sizes.},

  journal = {Marine Environmental Research}, 
  abstract = { The protection provided by marine reserves directly depends on the short and long-term movement patterns of local organisms. Although there has been an increase in research assessing the behavioural patterns of fishes in reef-based habitats, there is still a paucity of studies addressing the benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) for soft-sediment species. Here, we investigated both diel and seasonal shifts in spatial behaviour of the Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, within a recently-established marine reserve using long-term passive acoustic telemetry. Results showed variable levels of site attachment, with nearly half of the fish (n = 8) disappearing from the monitored area within 30 days, and the remaining (n = 9) being detected for periods up to 207 days and spending 95\% of their time within an average area of 0.88 ± 0.46 km2. Although detection frequency was higher during daytime periods, the larger home range areas and greater movement observed during nighttime periods are consistent with a nocturnal activity regime, which might increase the vulnerability of S. senegalensis to illegal fishing. Additionally, patterns observed during the spawning season suggest the existence of shifts in habitat use linked with reproductive activity, opening the door to further research on soles’ fine-scale interaction dynamics. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the ecology of a flatfish species and suggests that small no-take areas encompassing suitable soft-sediment habitats can offer adequate protection to at least part of the Senegalese sole population.},

Tagged fish were monitored for three months in two industrial scale sea-cages containing 180000 and 150000 fish, respectively. Each cage was fitted with two prototype acoustic receiver units designed to collect, interpret and store the information transmitted by the acoustic transmitter tags. Ten in each cage were also equipped with Data Storage Tags (DSTs) containing depth sensors to record individual-based datasets for comparison with the acoustically transmitted datasets. After compensation for sample loss caused by expected acoustic interference between the transmitter tags, the resulting dataset revealed that the receiver units collected 90–95\% of the signals in both cages. Acoustic communication conditions in the sea-cages were not strongly impaired by factors such as fish density and local noise. Further, the dataset from the acoustic transmitters had comparable resolution and quality to that produced by the DSTs. However, acoustic tags provide data in real time and enable farmers to respond to the received information with farm management measures, whereas archival tags such as DSTs need to be retrieved and downloaded and hence have no real-time applications. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is feasible as a method to monitor the depth of fish in real-time commercial aquaculture.},

The path of the Kuroshio fluctuated seasonally, leading to changes in water temperature that strongly influenced the habitat use of small PBF (2–3 months after hatching). Most PBF were present in coastal waters inshore of the path of the current, and their habitat use changed in response to the distance of the current from the coast. The Kuroshio typically flowed along the coast from summer to autumn, and PBF remained in the coastal waters off Kochi Prefecture during this period. In contrast, PBF quickly moved eastward in winter when the current moved away from the coast. Throughout the winter and spring, the area of habitat use extended widely from the eastern end of the southern coast of Japan (the Boso Peninsula) to the offshore Kuroshio‐Oyashio transition region. These findings suggest that the seasonal habitat use and movement behavior of juvenile PBF are influenced by the distance of the Kuroshio axis from the coast, and the ultimate drivers are likely variations in oceanographic conditions and prey availability along the southern coast of Japan.},

  abstract = {Over the past thirty years catches of skates have increased in the western Atlantic as a result of targeted fisheries and as by-catch. Presently, sustainable harvest levels for skates in the western Atlantic are unknown. Available life history information was used to model three western Atlantic skate species, little skate Leucoraja erinacea , winter skate Leucoraja ocellata , and barndooor skate Dipturus laevis , to determine their population growth rate and susceptibility to population decline under exploitation. Population characteristics were estimated using age-based matrix analyses for little and winter skate and a stage-based matrix approach for barndoor skate. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r) for little, winter and barndoor skates were 0.21, 0.13 and 0.20, respectively. Fishing mortality resulting in equilibrium conditions, where the intrinsic rate of increase is zero, were 0.35 for little skate, 0.16 for winter skate and 0.20 for barndoor skate. Elasticity analyses indicated that juvenile survival contributed most to population growth in little skate and winter skate, and adult survival contributed the most in barndoor skate. Thus, conservation measures should focus on juvenile and adult stages of these species. In the absence of fishing mortality, elasticity of fecundity was low for all species, however; at high exploitation levels the contribution of fecundity to population growth rate increased. Stochastic analyses were performed by varying first year mortality (egg stage to the completion of one year of life), and model parameters for each species to generate estimates of the distributions of biological reference points. Our study supports the finding that long-lived, slower growing, late maturing species are highly vulnerable to exploitation. Copyright 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Using behavioural states resolved from GPS tracking of foraging during the breeding season, we demonstrate that individual behaviours can be accurately predicted during multi-year migrations from low cost, lightweight, salt-water immersion devices. This reveals a complex pattern of migratory stopovers: some involving high proportions of foraging, and others of rest behaviour. We use this technique to examine three consecutive years of global migrations, revealing the prominence of foraging behaviour during migration and the importance of highly productive waters during migratory stopover.},

We examined 13,349 “movement ecology” papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35\% (n = 4, 672) of these papers, with the number of connections increasing over time.

However, for 25\% of these species, there was little movement research available to be used, highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research.

  abstract = {A Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) is a relatively new concept that estimates the path of an animal's movement probabilistically from data recorded at brief intervals. A BBMM assumes that locations are not independent, whereas the “classical” kernel-density estimator (KDE) assumes they are. We estimated BBMM home ranges for 11 Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) and 7 Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) equipped with satellite transmitters near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, from October 2006 to November 2008. The 95\% BBMM home ranges (95\% BBMM) of the two Black Vultures that traveled >100 km from the capture site were 833 and 2111 km2; of the nine that did not travel as far, 95\% BBMM ranged from 33 to 778 km2 and averaged (± SE) 243 ± 76 km2. The majority of Turkey Vultures (n = 6) traveled >100 km from the capture site with 95\% BBMM ranging from 923 to 7058 km2 and averaging 3173 ± 1109 km2. We also estimated KDE home ranges, using newer satellite technology for comparison with previous studies. Overall 95\% KDE ranged from 17 to 16066 km2 for the Black Vulture and 988 to 36257 km2 for the Turkey Vulture. The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have home-range estimators. With increasing use of satellite telemetry, application of BBMM can greatly enhance our understanding of home ranges, migration routes, seasonal movements, and habitat-use patterns of wild birds over large and often remote areas.Un modelo de movimiento de puente browniano (MMPB) es un concepto relativamente nuevo que estima la probabilidad de la trayectoria de movimiento de un animal a partir de datos registrados en intervalos breves. Un MMPB asume que las localizaciones no son independientes, mientras que el estimador de densidad de núcleo (EDD) “clásico” asume que sí lo son. Estimamos rangos de hogar MMPB para 11 individuos de Coragyps atratus y siete de Cathartes aura equipados con transmisores satelitales cerca de la Estación Aérea del Cuerpo de Marines Beaufort, Carolina del Sur, desde octubre de 2006 hasta noviembre de 2008. El 95\% de los rangos de hogar MMPB (95\% MMPB) de dos individuos de C. atratus que viajaron >100 km desde el sitio de captura fue 833 y 2111 km2; de los nueve que no viajaron tan lejos, el 95\% MMPB osciló entre 33 y 778 km2 y promedió (± EE) 243 ± 76 km2. La mayoría de los individuos de C. aura (n = 6) viajaron >100 km desde el sitio de captura con 95\% MMPB oscilando entre 923 y 7058 km2 y promediando 3173 ± 1109 km2.

En total, el 95\% EDD osciló entre 17 y 16066 km2 para C. atratus, y entre 988 y 36257 km2 para C. aura. El concepto del rango de hogar de un animal ha evolucionado a lo largo del tiempo, así como los estimadores del rango de hogar.

In recent years, the sicklefin lemon shark Negaprion acutidens has shown rapid range reductions and has even disappeared altogether in certain areas. In this study, the area use patterns and site fidelity of the N. acutidens were assessed at the St. Joseph Atoll in the Seychelles. Passive acoustic telemetry methods were employed to monitor the movements of 19 tagged individuals for 1 year. Area use within the lagoon of the atoll was found to be highly restricted, with individuals typically utilising a small portion of the available area throughout the year. A high-use zone was apparent in the south-east of the atoll’s lagoon, which was shared by many of the monitored individuals. Fidelity to the study site was found to be extremely high, with the 79 \% of tagged N. acutidens still present in the atoll at the end of the study. Individuals displayed both diel and tidal movements between the lagoon and surrounding habitats. The restricted area use and high site fidelity observed in this study highlight both the vulnerability of this species to rapid over exploitation and importance of remote habitats such as the St. Joseph Atoll in their future conservation. The results obtained here can be used to inform management decisions regarding the development and utilisation of similar atoll environments throughout the species’ range.},

  abstract = {Grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) are apex predators found on many Indo-Pacific coral reefs, but little is known about their movement patterns and habitat requirements. We used acoustic telemetry to determine movements and habitat use of these sharks at the isolated Rowley Shoals atolls, 250 km off the coast of north-western Australia. We equipped 12 male and 14 female sharks ranging from 0.79 to 1.69 m in total length with transmitters that were detected by an array of 11 strategically placed receivers on two atoll reefs. Over 26,000 detections were recorded over the 325 days of receiver deployment. No sharks were observed to move between reefs. Receivers on the outer slopes of reefs provided nearly all (99\%) of the detections. We found no differences in general attendance parameters due to size, sex or reef, except for maximum period of detection where larger sharks were detected over a longer period than smaller sharks. Male and female sharks were often detected at separate receivers at the outer slope habitat of one reef, suggesting sexual segregation, but this pattern did not occur at the second reef where males and females were detected at similar frequencies. We identified two patterns of daily behaviour: (1) sharks were present at the reef both day and night or (2) sharks spent more time in attendance during day than at night. Fast Fourier transforms identified 24-h cycles of attendance at the reef and a secondary peak of attendance at 12 h for most sharks, although no individuals shared the same attendance patterns. Our study provides baseline data that can be used to optimise the minimum area and habitat requirements for conservation of these apex predators.},

  journal = {Journal of Mammalogy}, 
  abstract = {Statisticians frequently voice concern that their interactions with applied researchers start only after data have been collected. The same can be said for our experience with home-range studies. Too often, conversations about home range begin with questions concerning estimation methods, smoothing parameters, or the nature of autocorrelation. More productive efforts start by asking good (and interesting) research questions; once these questions are defined, it becomes possible to ask how various design and analysis strategies influence one's ability to answer these questions. With this process in mind, we address key sample-design and data-analysis issues related to the topic of home range. The impact of choosing a particular home-range estimator (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, or local convex hull) will be question dependent, and for some problems other movement or use-based metrics (e.g., mean step lengths or time spent in particular areas) may be worthy of consideration. Thus, we argue the need for more question-driven and focused research and for clearly distinguishing the biological concept of an animal's home range from the statistical quantities one uses to investigate this concept. For comparative studies, it is important to standardize sampling regimes and estimation methods as much as possible, and to pay close attention to missing data issues. More attention should also be given to temporally changing space-use patterns, with biologically meaningful time periods (e.g., life-history stages) used to define sampling periods. Last, we argue the need for closer connections between theoretical and empirical researchers. Advances in ecological theory, and its application to natural resources management, will require carefully designed research studies to test theoretical predictions from more mechanistic modeling approaches.},

  journal = {Conservation Biology}, 
  abstract = {Evidence for severe declines in large predatory fishes is increasing around the world. Because of its long history of intense fishing, the Mediterranean Sea offers a unique perspective on fish population declines over historical timescales. We used a diverse set of records dating back to the early 19th and mid 20th century to reconstruct long-term population trends of large predatory sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We compiled 9 time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records. Generalized linear models were used to extract instantaneous rates of change from each data set, and a meta-analysis was conducted to compare population trends. Only 5 of the 20 species we considered had sufficient records for analysis. Hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), blue (Prionace glauca), mackerel (Isurus oxyrinchus and Lamna nasus), and thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) declined between 96 and 99.99\% relative to their former abundance. According to World Conservation Union (IUCN) criteria, these species would be considered critically endangered. So far, the lack of quantitative population assessments has impeded shark conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study fills this critical information gap, suggesting that current levels of exploitation put large sharks at risk of extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Possible ecosystem effects of these losses involve a disruption of top-down control and a release of midlevel consumers. Resumen:  La evidencia de declinaciones severas de peces depredadores grandes está incrementando alrededor del mundo. Debido a su larga historia de pesca intensiva, el Mar Mediterráneo ofrece una perspectiva única de las declinaciones de poblaciones de peces en escalas de tiempo histórico. Utilizamos un conjunto diverso de registros que datan de inicios del siglo XIX hasta mediados del siglo XX para reconstruir las tendencias poblacionales de largo plazo de tiburones depredadores en el noroeste del Mar Mediterráneo. Compilamos 9 series de tiempo de índices de abundancia de capturas comerciales y recreativas, muestreos científicos y registros visuales. Usamos modelos lineales generalizados para extraer tasas de cambio instantáneas de cada conjunto de datos, y realizamos un meta-análisis para comparar tendencias poblacionales. Solo 5 de las 20 especies consideradas tuvieron suficientes datos para el análisis. Sphyrna spp., Prionace glauca, Isurus oxyrinchus, Lamna nasu y Alopias vulpinus declinaron entre 96 y 99.99\% en relación con su abundancia anterior. De acuerdo con criterios de la Unión Mundial de Conservación (IUCN), estas especies serían consideradas en peligro crítico. Hasta ahora, la falta de evaluaciones poblacionales cuantitativas ha impedido la conservación de tiburones en el Mar Mediterráneo. Nuestro estudio llena este vacío de información crítico, lo cual sugiere que los niveles actuales de explotación han puesto en riesgo de extinción a los tiburones grandes en el Mar Mediterráneo. Los posibles efectos de estas pérdidas a nivel ecosistema implican una interferencia del control arriba-abajo y la detonación de consumidores primarios.},

However, many human-populated coastal areas have been developed, making them unavailable to coastal fish populations. The Full Tidal Basin (FTB) of the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, California, USA, was completed in 2006, with the aim to restore lost estuarine habitat in southern California. Monthly abundance surveys conducted inside the FTB between June 2008 and September 2009 showed that shovelnose guitarfish were present throughout the year. Over 96\% of the individuals caught were juveniles and these were most abundant in waters between 20°C and 24°C. Concurrently, 23 shovelnose guitarfish were fitted with coded acoustic transmitters and continuously tracked within the FTB for 16 months. Telemetry data showed individuals remained inside the FTB for, on average, 73.9 days (range 15–172 days), and made few movements between the FTB and the ocean. Tagged individuals disproportionately used mud habitats and waters at temperatures of 22°C, both of which are more common in the FTB than the neighbouring coastal ocean. The present study examined the structure and functionality of a restored estuary and suggests that the FTB is important habitat for a benthic predator, a promising result three years after restoration.},

  abstract = {Arrays of passive receivers are a widely used tool for tracking the movements of acoustically-tagged fish in marine ecosystems; however, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of coral reef environments pose challenges for the interpretation of tag detection data. To improve this situation for reef fishes, we introduced a novel response variable method that treats signal detections as proportions (i.e., percent transmissions detected or “detection rates”) and compared this against prior approaches to examine the influence of array and transmitter performance, signal distance and environmental factors on detection rates. We applied this method to tagged snappers and groupers in the Florida reef ecosystem and controlled range-tests on static targets in Bayboro Harbor, Florida, to provide methodological guidance for the planning and evaluation of passive array studies for coral reef fishes. Logistic regression analysis indicated detection rates were primarily a non-linear function of tag distance from receiver. A ‘model-weighted’ function was developed to incorporate the non-linear relationship between detection rate and distance to provide robust positioning estimates and allow for easy extension to tags with different ping rates. Optimal acoustic array design requires balancing the interplay between receiver spacing, detection rates, and positioning error. Spacing receivers at twice the distance of the modeled 50\% detection rate may be appropriate when quantification of overall space use is a priority, and would provide a minimum of 75\% detection rate. However, for research where missing detections within the array is unacceptable or time-at-arrival based fine-scale positioning is needed, tighter receiver spacing may be required to maintain signal detection probability near 100\%.},

Commonly used statistical home range models, such as minimum convex polygon (MCP) or 95\% kernel density (95\% KD) methods, require the exclusion of individuals who move beyond the bounds of the tracking study. Spatially explicit individual-based models of fish home range movements parameterized from multiple years of acoustic tracking data were developed for three exploited coral reef fishes (red grouper Epinephelus morio, black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and mutton snapper Lutjanus analis) in Dry Tortugas, Florida. Movements were characterized as a combination of probability of movement, distance moved, and turning angle. Simulations suggested that the limited temporal and geographic scope of most movement studies may underestimate home range size, especially for fish with home range centers near the edges of the array. Simulations provided useful upper bounds for home range size (red grouper: 2.28 ± 0.81  km2 MCP, 3.60 ± 0.89  km2 KD; black grouper: 2.06 ± 0.84  km2 MCP, 3.93 ± 1.22  km2 KD; mutton snapper: 7.72 ± 2.23  km2 MCP, 6.16 ± 1.11  km2 KD).

  abstract = { Large numbers of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii) migrate into the warm shelf waters of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) each austral summer. Whilst in the GAB, they aggregate in schools that spend substantial periods in the surface layer of the water column. In this study we investigate biological, temporal and environmental factors influencing this surfacing phenomena using an extensive archival tagging dataset collected between 1998 and 2011. High frequency data on the vertical movement of SBT collected by these tags were used to calculate the proportion of time fish spent in the shallowest 20 m during each day and night period. Estimates of fish location derived from light sensor data on the tags allowed us to investigate the influence that local environmental conditions had on a fish's surfacing behaviour. Although there is high variability in surfacing behaviour within and between individuals, some general patterns emerge. There are clear diel differences in surfacing, with the proportion of time fish spend at the surface tending to be high during most days and either very high (>90\%) or very low (<10\%) during most nights. Complex relationships were found between surfacing behaviour and the environmental variables considered (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, salinity and wind speed). The results from this study have relevance to the commercial purse-seine fishery targeting surface schools of SBT in the GAB during the austral summer, as well as the scientific aerial survey conducted each summer that collects data on sightings of surface schools of SBT in order to derive a relative abundance index used directly in management.},

  journal = {PLOS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012–2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36\%) exhibited medium (0.20–0.40) or high residency (> 0.50). A large portion of the population (51\%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76\%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.},

The present study examined shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall, 21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded. Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most abundant species (>64\% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species, indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for those patterns is essential for developing sound management and conservation approaches.},

Twelve C. cautus were tagged with acoustic tags and monitored for up to 579 days. Based on individuals detected within the receiver array for at least 2 months, C. cautus had small core (50\% kernel utilization distribution, KUD) and home ranges (95\% KUD) of 0·66 and 3·64 km2, respectively, and showed a strong habitat preference for mangroves, which are only found in the no-take zone. This resulted in C. cautus spending most of their detected time within the no-take zone boundaries (mean = 81·5\%), showing that such a protected area could be beneficial to protect this species from extensive fishing pressure and local depletion, where required. Not all C. cautus remained within the acoustic array, however, suggesting that individual variations occur and that not all individuals would benefit from such protection. This study provides important information about the habitat, residency and movements of C. cautus that can be used for management and conservation. The strong affinity and residency of C. cautus within a mangrove-fringing coastline, emphasizes the importance of mangrove habitat to the species and suggests that such preferences can be used to design appropriate no-take zones for this species or others with similar habitat preferences.},

These networks can significantly augment research projects by increasing the geographic coverage of detection data beyond the initial monitored area, and encourage the development of research collaborations with the goal of improving aquatic research management. As tags expire and projects end, researchers must decide whether to maintain their receiver stations, adjust the configuration to accommodate a new scope of research, or remove the stations. We assessed telemetry data from two projects designed to monitor fishes in nearshore and offshore habitats of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to determine the configuration of receiver stations most informative for network scale monitoring. Modeled on the Index of Relative Importance commonly used to analyze fish diets, the Receiver Efficiency Index (REI) allowed us to reduce the size of the two arrays from 59 to 24 and 33 to 21 stations, reductions of 59\% and 27\%, while retaining more than 75\% of all detections. The application of this method has general relevance to understanding the spatial dynamics of these arrays while providing researchers with a quantitative tool to guide decision making that can maximize spatial coverage at the lowest maintenance cost.},

  abstract = {Depth recorders are among the most useful tools available for ornithologists interested in waterbird foraging behavior. Despite their widespread use in the literature, there is little information available about their precision and accuracy, including, for the case of TDRs, device drift. We examined the uncertainty associated with two types of depth-recorders deployed on Thick-billed Murres Uria lomvia in the Canadian Arctic in 2007 for up to 48 hours. The maximum depth obtained by capillary tube maximum-depth gauges (MDGs), a cheap and simple depth-recorder, was highly correlated (R2 = 0.87) with maximum depth obtained by electronic time-depth recorders (TDRs) attached to the same bird (n = 29) up to depths of 100 m. Deeper than 100 m or in deployments of 144 hours, MDGs were unreliable. We suggest that the maximum depth for Thick-billed Murres in the Canadian Arctic is about 150 m, rather than the 210 meters previously reported using MDGs recorders, and that caution should be used when quoting maximal maximum depths for species diving deeper than 100 m using this method. We also attached two Lotek TDRs to the same bird (n = 18) and examined the similarity of the two recorders. The average difference increased from about 0.5 m near the surface to about 1.0 m below 60 m, with extreme differences of up to 4 m obtained. Furthermore, TDRs submerged to known depth were accurate within ± 2 m. The effect of these variations on measurements of maximum and average depth and duration was about 0.6–1.3 m (depth) or s (duration), which is similar to the manufacturer's accuracy specifications (±1\%). Finally, we examined the drift (offset from zero at the surface) within the TDRs. Drift varied from -2.5 to + 2 m, with 9 out of 36 recorders showing no drift, and no change amongst years for individual recorders. Drift was lowest (most negative) at the colony, higher during flight and highest (most positive) on the water surface, despite very small differences in altitude (<50 m). We suggest that drift may be a useful tool for quantifying at-sea behavior, especially in conjunction with temperature logs. We conclude that MDGs are reliable up to 100 m and within 48 hours, and that TDRs are precise within ±2\%, but that more research needs to be completed on device accuracy and precision.},

MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve3,4,5. Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old (>10 years), large (>100 km2), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large (>250 mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59\%) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.},

  abstract = {Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (Class Chondrichthyes; herein ‘sharks’) are the earliest extant jawed vertebrates and exhibit some of the greatest functional diversity of all vertebrates. Ecologically, they influence energy transfer vertically through trophic levels and sometimes trophic cascades via direct consumption and predation risk. Through movements and migrations, they connect horizontally and temporally across habitats and ecosystems, integrating energy flows at large spatial scales and across time. This connectivity flows from ontogenetic growth in size and spatial movements, which in turn underpins their relatively low reproductive rates compared with other exploited ocean fishes. Sharks are also ecologically and demographically diverse and are taken in a wide variety of fisheries for multiple products (e.g. meat, fins, teeth, and gills). Consequently, a range of fisheries management measures are generally preferable to ‘silver bullet’ and ‘one size fits all’ conservation actions. Some species with extremely low annual reproductive output can easily become endangered and hence require strict protections to minimize mortality. Other, more prolific species can withstand fishing over the long term if catches are subject to effective catch limits throughout the species’ range. We identify, based on the IUCN Red List status, 64 endangered species in particular need of new or stricter protections and 514 species in need of improvements to fisheries management. We designate priority countries for such actions, recognizing the widely differing fishing pressures and conservation capacity. We hope that this analysis assists efforts to ensure this group of ecologically important and evolutionarily distinct animals can support both ocean ecosystems and human activities in the future.},

  author = {Dulvy, Nicholas K and Metcalfe, Julian D and Glanville, Jamie and Pawson, Mike G and Reynolds, John D}, 
  journal = {Conservation Biology}, 
  abstract = {Skates are arguably the most vulnerable of exploited marine fishes. Their vulnerability is often as-
 sessed by examining fisheries catch trends, but these data are not generally recorded on a species basis except
 in  France.  Aggregated  skate  catch  statistics  tend  to  exhibit  more  stable  trends  than  those  of  other  elasmo-
 branch fisheries. We tested whether such apparent stability in aggregated catch trends could mask population
 declines of individual species. We examined two time series of species-specific surveys of a relatively stable
 skate fishery in the northeast Atlantic. These surveys revealed the disappearance of two skate species, long-
 nose skate (  
 Dipturus oxyrhinchus  
 ) and white skate (  
 Rostroraja alba  
 ) and confirmed a previously documented
 decline of the common skate (  
 D. batis  
 ). Of the remaining five skate species, the three larger ones have de-
 clined, whereas two smaller species have increased in abundance. The increase in abundance and biomass of
 the smaller species has resulted in the stability of the aggregated catch trends. Because there is significant di-
 etary overlap among species, we suggest the increase in abundance of the smaller species may be due to com-
 petitive release as the larger species declined. A consequence of this kind of stability is that declining species
 cannot be detected without species-specific data, especially in taxa exhibiting competitive interactions. This
 may explain why previously documented disappearances of two species of skates went unnoticed for so long.
 The conservation of skates and other elasmobranchs requires species-specific monitoring and special atten-
 tion to larger species.},

  abstract = {Relatively few marine fishes have been assessed under World Conservation Union criteria, yet it is believed that marine fish extinction rates have been underestimated by one order of magnitude (McKinney 1999). Given the paucity of data required for traditional assessment methods, we explored the use of potential correlates of extinction vulnerability to prioritize species for conservation assessment. We focused on the world's 230 species of skates and rays (Rajidae) because they have been identified as one of the most vulnerable groups of marine fishes. We searched for all documented cases of local extinction and compiled a database of body size and latitudinal and depth ranges for all species for which data were available. We found that species that have disappeared from substantial parts of their ranges ( “locally extinct” ) have large body sizes compared with all other skates, but that latitudinal and depth ranges were similar to those of other species. The body size correlate may be due to higher mortality rates and correlations with life-history parameters such as late age at maturity. We used the locally extinct species that had the smallest size or ranges as benchmarks to generate lists of other species that may be vulnerable. Body size generated the smallest species list (7), excluding the known local extinctions, compared with lists generated by size of latitudinal (150) or depth range (63). Body size was the only trait that correctly identified the known local extinctions, suggesting that it is more useful than range sizes for identifying potentially vulnerable fishes. This provides a simple, objective method of prioritizing species for further assessment, which complements direct methods that are more data-intensive and time-consuming. Resumen: Pocos peces marinos han sido evaluados según los criterios de la UICN, sin embargo se cree que las tasas de extinción de peces marinos han sido subestimadas por un orden de magnitud (McKinney, 1999). Dada la escasez de los datos requeridos por los métodos de evaluación tradicional, exploramos el uso de correlaciones potenciales de vulnerabilidad de extinción para priorizar especies para la valoración de su conservación. Nos enfocamos en las 230 especies de rayas del mundo (Rajidae) puesto que han sido identificadas como uno de los grupos de especies marinas más vulnerables. Buscamos todos los casos documentados de extinción local y recopilamos una base de datos de tamaño corporal y rangos latitudinales y de profundidad para todas las especies de las que existen datos disponibles. Encontramos que las especies que han desaparecido de partes sustanciales de sus rangos de distribución (“localmente extintas”) han tenido cuerpos grandes comparadas con las otras rayas, pero sus rangos latitudinales y de profundidad fueron similares a los de las otras especies. La correlación del tamaño del cuerpo puede ser debida a tasas de mortalidad más altas y a correlaciones con parámetros de la historia de vida como lo es la edad avanzada al madurar. Usamos las especies localmente extintas que tenían los tamaños más pequeños o los rangos más pequeños como referencias para generar listas de otras especies que pueden ser vulnerables. El tamaño corporal generó la lista más corta (7), excluyendo las extinciones locales conocidas, comparada con la lista generada por el tamaño del rango latitudinal (150) o el tamaño del rango de profundidad (63). El tamaño corporal fue la única característica que identificó correctamente las extinciones locales conocidas, sugiriendo que es mas útil que los tamaños de los rangos para identificar peces potencialmente vulnerables. Esto provee un método simple y objetivo para priorizar especies para evaluaciones futuras, lo cual complementa métodos directos que requieren datos intensivos y consumen mucho tiempo.},

Low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. Incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. Here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture–mark–recapture analysis using open population models. Our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in Tasmania, Australia. Cormack–Jolly–Seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. The apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. Combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into Jolly–Seber models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture–mark–recapture studies in the marine environment. Future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program.},

To examine the movements of manta rays in the Komodo Marine Park, Indonesia, an acoustic array was installed at up to seven sites in the park between 2000 and 2003. A total of 41 acoustic tags were deployed in three separate deployments in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Mantas were recorded in the park for up to 526 days with an average duration of 183 ± 136 days, when mantas made from 3 to 303 individual visits to different sites (median 58 visits). There was a clear preference for three sites that comprised over 90\% of manta activity. The most popular site (German Flag) was off the southern tip of Komodo Island in an area with a high degree of bathymetric structure. Examination of the longest records suggests some site preference with 5 of 7 individuals spending greater than 90\% of their time at the location where they were tagged. Using a general linear model it was possible to examine the effects of daytime, lunar phase, aggregation site, season and tidal phase on visitation patterns. The vast majority of visits were recorded during daylight hours at all sites. The strongest effects of both the lunar and tidal phase were apparent in the northern sites with the most visits occurring when tidal intensity was the greatest during full and new moons. The strongest seasonal pattern was observed in the south where no mantas were recorded during the first quarter in any year. This coincides with an increase in temperature and reduction of productivity in this region associated with monsoonal shifts. The long-term fidelity indicates that marine-protected areas centered around aggregation sites could help protect this species from overexploitation.},

  abstract = {A vulnerable species group, such as, the elasmobranchs, in a data-deficient context presents a complicated management problem. Evidence suggests that the Azores islands, a remote archipelago on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, serve essential functions in the life-history of species across taxa. The diversity of marine resources within its EEZ are exploited by local to international fleets, and the full extent of fishing pressure can often be underestimated. Although sharks and rays appear to be of minor importance in the fishery, the possibilities of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing raises concerns about these threatened species. However, this group has failed to attract management attention, visible in the lack of regional studies focused on biodiversity, ecology, or threats of elasmobranchs. Our work attempts to review and update the information on elasmobranchs of the Azores and identify potential threats, mainly by the local fisheries. We aim to highlight knowledge gaps that require further research and conservation actions. We (1) update the annotated checklist of elasmobranch species, (2) compare species distribution across a biogeographically similar section of the North Atlantic, and (3) analyze the interaction of elasmobranch species with local fisheries. We confirm 61 chondrichthyan species for the Azores (39 sharks, 17 rays, and 5 chimaeras), adding 19 species to the previous annotated checklist of 1997. The Azores elasmobranch species assemblage most resembles Madeira, the neighboring Macaronesian archipelago. Biogeographic affinities between the chosen regions of the North Atlantic are reflected in the taxonomic structure of families. Although underestimated in the local fisheries, elasmobranchs constitute a regular but highly variable portion of total landings. Misreporting and misidentification is perhaps the greatest concern in the local fisheries records, further aggravated by few existing catch regulations for elasmobranchs. Local knowledge indicates that the Azores serves as essential habitat for at least a few species in coastal areas and shallow seamounts, and potentially so for a number of deep-sea elasmobranchs. The intersection of fishery threats and local essential habitat functions around the archipelago warrants greater research effort and studies.},

  journal = {PLoS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) are globally distributed top predators that play an important ecological role within coastal marine communities. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal scales of their habitat use and associated ecological role. In this study, we employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the residency patterns and migration dynamics of 18 adult bull sharks (195–283 cm total length) tagged in southern Mozambique for a period of between 10 and 22 months. The majority of sharks (n = 16) exhibited temporally and spatially variable residency patterns interspersed with migration events. Ten individuals undertook coastal migrations that ranged between 433 and 709 km (mean = 533 km) with eight of these sharks returning to the study site. During migration, individuals exhibited rates of movement between 2 and 59 km.d−1 (mean = 17.58 km.d−1) and were recorded travelling annual distances of between 450 and 3760 km (mean = 1163 km). Migration towards lower latitudes primarily took place in austral spring and winter and there was a significant negative correlation between residency and mean monthly sea temperature at the study site. This suggested that seasonal change is the primary driver behind migration events but further investigation is required to assess how foraging and reproductive activity may influence residency patterns and migration. Results from this study highlight the need for further understanding of bull shark migration dynamics and suggest that effective conservation strategies for this vulnerable species necessitate the incorporation of congruent trans-boundary policies over large spatial scales.},

  journal = {Journal of Biogeography}, 
  abstract = {Aim  We present elements of a new conceptual framework for the unification of biogeography and movement ecology, and demonstrate the value of the new framework using a case study of two species of Afrotropical duck (Anatidae) across a latitudinal gradient. Location  Southern Africa. Methods  The first part of the paper rests on logic and philosophy. For the second (case study) section, we used data from up to 3 years of satellite telemetry for 26 individuals of two species of Afrotropical duck, the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and red-billed teal (Anas erythrorhyncha), from three different populations with moulting sites spread across 17 degrees of latitude. We compared quantitative measures of movement patterns using principal components analysis and boxplots. Results  We argue that unpacking the concept of dispersal into the fundamental elements of movement (internal drivers, external drivers, navigation capacity, and motion capacity) provides a more solid basis for contrasting competing hypotheses in biogeographical studies. We found, surprisingly, that red-billed teal, a ‘highly nomadic’ species, moved with a relatively high degree of consistency at each of our three study latitudes, while Egyptian geese, a ‘resident’ species, showed latitude-dependent variation in their movements. However, much of the latitude-related variation for Egyptian geese was driven by their annual moult migrations, rather than directly by fluctuations in resource availability. Internal factors appear to dominate movements and probably determine the species ranges of both of our study species. Main conclusions  The integration of biogeography and movement ecology, through a more sophisticated view of mechanisms formerly lumped together under ‘dispersal’, offers a fertile area for further research. The biogeography of Afrotropical ducks appears to be strongly influenced by internal factors. Biogeographical patterns in this taxon may thus be best understood (and modelled) as a long-term response to environmental stochasticity, rather than as a deliberate selection of optimal habitat. Latitudinal comparisons emerge as a valuable way of gaining insights into the drivers of movement for widespread species.},

This set of tools ranges from transmitters that send their signals to receivers up to a few kilometers away to those that send data to orbiting satellites and, more frequently, to devices that log data. They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.},

Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

However, some species, due to their ecological characteristics, may not respond positively to protection. Very little is known about the effects of life history and ecological traits (e.g., mobility, growth, and habitat) on responses of fish species to marine reserves. Using 40 data sets from 12 European marine reserves, we show that there is significant variation in the response of different species of fish to protection and that this heterogeneity can be explained, in part, by differences in their traits. Densities of targeted size-classes of commercial species were greater in protected than unprotected areas. This effect of protection increased as the maximum body size of the targeted species increased, and it was greater for species that were not obligate schoolers. However, contrary to previous theoretical findings, even mobile species with wide home ranges benefited from protection: the effect of protection was at least as strong for mobile species as it was for sedentary ones. Noncommercial bycatch and unexploited species rarely responded to protection, and when they did (in the case of unexploited bentho-pelagic species), they exhibited the opposite response: their densities were lower inside reserves. The use of marine reserves for marine conservation and fisheries management implies that they should ensure protection for a wide range of species with different life-history and ecological traits. Our results suggest this is not the case, and instead that effects vary with economic value, body size, habitat, depth range, and schooling behavior.},

  journal = {Conservation Biology}, 
  abstract = {Accurate assessment of shark population status is essential for conservation but is often constrained by limited and unreliable data. To provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5\% per year [CI 2\% to 8\%]), for mako sharks in the North Pacific (by 7\% per year [CI 3\% to 11\%]), and for oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17\% per year [CI 14\% to 20\%]). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However, there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries. In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate. Tendencias Poblacionales de Tiburones del Océano Pacífico y la Utilidad de Regulaciones sobre Cercenamiento de Aletas La evaluación precisa del estatus de las poblaciones de tiburón es esencial para la conservación pero a menudo es constreñida por datos limitados y poco confiables. Para proporcionar una base para un mejor manejo del recurso tiburón, analizamos un registro de largo plazo sobre la captura de especies, tamaños y sexos de tiburón recolectados por observadores a bordo de embarcaciones en el Pacífico occidental y central de 1995 a 2010. Utilizando modelos lineales generalizados, estimamos indicadores del estatus de la población con base en la tasa de captura e indicadores biológicos de la presión de pesca con base en tamaño medio para identificar tendencias para Prionace glauca, Isurus spp., Carcharhinus longimanus y Carcharhinus falciformis. Las tasas de captura estandarizadas declinaron significativamente para P. glauca en el Pacífico Norte (5\% por año [IC 2\% a 8\%]), para I. spp. en el Pacífico Norte (7\% por año [IC 3\% a 11\%] y para C. longimanus en aguas tropicales (17\% por año [IC 14\% a 20\%]). Los tamaños medios de C. falciformis y C. longimanus decrecieron significativamente en su hábitat núcleo, y casi todos los individuos de C. falciformis eran inmaduros. Nuestros resultados son consistentes con los análisis de conjuntos de datos similares. Combinados, estos resultados y evidencia de la pesca de tiburones en algunas pesquerías regionales aumentan la preoocupación por el uso sustentable de tiburones, particularmente de C. longimanus y P. glauca, no son sustentables. En 2007 se decretaron regulaciones regionales que prohíben el cercenamiento de aletas de tiburón (remoción de aletas y eliminación del cuerpo) y en muchos casos son la única forma de control de la captura de tiburones. Sin embargo, hay poca evidencia de la reducción del cercenamiento en las pesquerías. Adicionalmente, C. longimanus y P. glauca son retenidos más frecuentemente que cercenados, lo que sugiere que aun con la implementación plena de y la adhesión a una prohibición de cercenamiento puede que no se reduzcan sustancialmente las tasas de mortalidad de estas especies. Argumentamos que las prohibiciones de cercenamiento desvían la atención de la evaluación de la sustentabilidad de los niveles de captura y que la necesidad del manejo de tiburones no debe ser abordada con medidas que son sencillas de implementar pero complejas de aplicar y evaluar.},

  abstract = {Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

The model consists of momentum, continuity, temperature, salinity, and density equations and is closed physically and mathematically using the Mellor and Yamada level-2.5 turbulent closure submodel. The irregular bottom slope is represented using a σ-coordinate transformation, and the horizontal grids comprise unstructured triangular cells. The finite-volume method (FVM) used in this model combines the advantages of a finite-element method (FEM) for geometric flexibility and a finite-difference method (FDM) for simple discrete computation. Currents, temperature, and salinity in the model are computed in the integral form of the equations, which provides a better representation of the conservative laws for mass, momentum, and heat in the coastal region with complex geometry. The model was applied to the Bohai Sea, a semienclosed coastal ocean, and the Satilla River, a Georgia estuary characterized by numerous tidal creeks and inlets. Compared with the results obtained from the finite-difference model (ECOM-si), the new model produces a better simulation of tidal elevations and residual currents, especially around islands and tidal creeks. Given the same initial distribution of temperature in the Bohai Sea, the FVCOM and ECOM-si models show similar distributions of temperature and stratified tidal rectified flow in the interior region away from the coast and islands, but FVCOM appears to provide a better simulation of temperature and currents around the islands, barriers, and inlets with complex topography.},

  abstract = {The overexploitation of sharks has become a global environmental issue in need of a comprehensive and multifaceted management response. Tracking studies are beginning to elucidate how shark movements shape the internal dynamics and structure of populations, which determine the most appropriate scale of these management efforts. Tracked sharks frequently either remain in a restricted geographic area for an extended period of time (residency) or return to a previously resided-in area after making long-distance movements (site fidelity). Genetic studies have shown that some individuals of certain species preferentially return to their exact birthplaces (natal philopatry) or birth regions (regional philopatry) for either parturition or mating, even though they make long-distance movements that would allow them to breed elsewhere. More than 80 peer-reviewed articles, constituting the majority of published shark tracking and population genetic studies, provide evidence of at least one of these behaviors in a combined 31 shark species from six of the eight extant orders. Residency, site fidelity, and philopatry can alone or in combination structure many coastal shark populations on finer geographic scales than expected based on their potential for dispersal. This information should therefore be used to scale and inform assessment, management, and conservation activities intended to restore depleted shark populations.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Marine Science Volume 7 is January 03, 2015.

Methods  We compiled seasonal nesting activity data from all reliable continuous long-term studies (> 25 years), which comprised data series for six of the world's major green turtle rookeries. We estimated the underlying time-specific trend in these six rookery-specific nester or nest abundance series using a generalized smoothing spline regression approach.
Results  Estimated rates of nesting population increase ranged from c. 4–14\% per annum over the past two to three decades. These rates varied considerably among the rookeries, reflecting the level of historical exploitation. Similar increases in nesting population were also evident for many other green turtle stocks that have been monitored for shorter durations than the long-term studies presented here.
Main conclusions  We show that six of the major green turtle nesting populations in the world have been increasing over the past two to three decades following protection from human hazards such as exploitation of eggs and turtles. This population recovery or rebound capacity is encouraging and suggests that the green turtle is not on the brink of global extinction even though some stocks have been seriously depleted and are still below historical abundance levels. This demonstrates that relatively simple conservation strategies can have a profound effect on the recovery of once-depleted green turtle stocks and presumably the restoration of their ecological function as major marine consumers.},

Central to answering these questions is our ability to correctly identify and quantify the frequency of essential behaviours, such as foraging. Despite technological advances that have increased the quality and resolution of location and dive data, accurately interpreting behaviour from such data remains a challenge, and analytical methods are only beginning to unlock the full potential of existing datasets. This review evaluates both traditional and emerging methods and presents a starting platform of options for future studies of marine predator foraging ecology, particularly from location and two-dimensional (time-depth) dive data. We outline the different devices and data types available, discuss the limitations and advantages of commonly-used analytical techniques, and highlight key areas for future research. We focus our review on pinnipeds - one of the most studied taxa of marine predators - but offer insights that will be applicable to other air-breathing marine predator tracking studies. We highlight that traditionally-used methods for inferring foraging from location and dive data, such as first-passage time and dive shape analysis, have important caveats and limitations depending on the nature of the data and the research question. We suggest that more holistic statistical techniques, such as state-space models, which can synthesise multiple track, dive and environmental metrics whilst simultaneously accounting for measurement error, offer more robust alternatives. Finally, we identify a need for more research to elucidate the role of physical oceanography, device effects, study animal selection, and developmental stages in predator behaviour and data interpretation.},

Acoustic telemetry was used to track the movements of seven rays in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Rays were tracked continuously over 31–74 h periods. Geographical movements were analyzed to determine space utilization and rate of movement. Rays were found to utilize significantly larger activity spaces at night (0.83±0.70 km2) (mean±SD) than during the day (0.12±0.15 km2). Mean total activity space for rays tracked was 1.32±0.75 km2. Rates of movement were also significantly higher at night (0.34±0.30 km h-1) than during the day (0.15±0.22 km h-1). Average straight-line swimming speed was 0.64±0.16 km h-1, with a maximum observed swimming speed of 1.9 km h-1. Tidal stage had no effect on rate of movement. Comparison with previously published data on juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini, in Kaneohe Bay revealed a high degree of overlap in habitat use and time of activity, suggesting possible ecological interactions between these two species.},

Acoustic monitoring data were used to define the residency and movement patterns of sharks within Crooked Island Sound, Florida. Over 3 years, sharks were monitored for periods of 1–37 days, with individuals regularly moving in and out of the study site. Individual sharks were continuously present within the study site for periods of 1–35 days. Patterns of movement could not be correlated with time of day. Home range sizes were typically small (average = 1.29 km2) and did not vary on a yearly basis. Gillnet sampling revealed that juvenile Atlantic sharpnose sharks were present in all habitat types found within Crooked Island Sound, and peaks in abundance varied depending on month within a year. Although telemetry data showed that most individuals remained within the study site for short periods of time before emigrating, conventional tag–recapture data indicates some individuals return to Crooked Island Sound after extended absences (maximum length = 1,352 days). Although conventional shark nursery theory suggests small sharks remain in shallow coastal waters to avoid predation, juvenile Atlantic sharpnose sharks frequently exited from protected areas and appear to move through deeper waters to adjacent coastal bays and estuaries. Given the high productivity exhibited by this species, the benefit gained through a nursery that reduces predation may be limited for this species.},

  abstract = {As part of a project to identify marine protected areas (MPAs) in Spanish Mediterranean waters, habitat preference models were developed using 11 years of survey data to provide predictions of relative density for cetacean species occurring off southern Spain.2.Models for bottlenose, striped and common dolphin described, firstly, probability of occurrence (using GLMs) and, secondly, group size (using linear models) as predicted by habitat type defined by a range of physical and oceanographic covariates. Models for Risso's dolphin, long-finned pilot, sperm and beaked whales used only the first stage because of data limitations.3.Model results were used to define the boundaries of three proposed Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) (under the EU Habitats Directive) and one proposed Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) (under the Barcelona Convention).4.The study illustrates the value of habitat preference modelling as a tool to help identify potential MPAs. The analyses incorporate environmental data in a spatial prediction that is an improvement over simpler descriptions of animal occurrence. Contiguous areas covering a specified proportion of relative abundance can readily be defined. Areas with apparently good habitat but few observations can be identified for future research or monitoring programmes.5.Models can be refitted as new observations and additional environmental data become available, allowing changes in habitat preference to be investigated and monitoring how well MPAs are likely to be affording protection.6.The study represents an important contribution to the implementation of the Habitats Directive by the Spanish government by providing a robust scientific basis for the definition of SAC and providing results to inform conservation objectives and management plans for these areas. The results identified areas that are important for a number of cetacean species, thus illustrating the potential for MPAs to improve cetacean conservation generally in the Alboran Sea, a region of great importance for supporting biodiversity and ecological processes in the wider Mediterranean Sea.

  journal = {Frontiers in Veterinary Science}, 
  abstract = {Connectivity in an aquatic setting is determined by a combination of hydrodynamic circulation and the biology of the organisms driving linkages. These complex processes can be simulated in coupled biological-physical models. The physical model refers to an underlying circulation model defined by spatially-explicit nodes, often incorporating a particle-tracking model. The particles can then be given biological parameters or behaviors (such as maturity and/or survivability rates, diel vertical migrations, avoidance, or seeking behaviors). The output of the bio-physical models can then be used to quantify connectivity among the nodes emitting and/or receiving the particles. Here we propose a method that makes use of kernel density estimation (KDE) on the output of a particle-tracking model, to quantify the infection or infestation pressure (IP) that each node causes on the surrounding area. Because IP is the product of both exposure time and the concentration of infectious agent particles, using KDE (which also combine elements of time and space), more accurately captures IP. This method is especially useful for those interested in infectious agent networks, a situation where IP is a superior measure of connectivity than the probability of particles from each node reaching other nodes. Here we illustrate the method by modeling the connectivity of salmon farms via sea lice larvae in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada. Analysis revealed evidence of two sub-networks of farms connected via a single farm, and evidence that the highest IP from a given emitting farm was often tens of kilometers or more away from that farm. We also classified farms as net emitters, receivers, or balanced, based on their structural role within the network. By better understanding how these salmon farms are connected to each other via their sea lice larvae, we can effectively focus management efforts to minimize the spread of sea lice between farms, advise on future site locations and coordinated treatment efforts, and minimize any impact of farms on juvenile wild salmon. The method has wide applicability for any system where capturing infectious agent networks can provide useful guidance for management or preventative planning decisions.},

  journal = {Coral Reefs}, 
  abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the movement patterns, behavior and site fidelity of marine organisms, but to accurately interpret acoustic data, the variability, periodicity and range of detectability between acoustic tags and receivers must be understood. The relative and interactive effects of topography with biological and environmental noise have not been quantified on coral reefs. We conduct two long-term range tests (1- and 4-month duration) on two different reef types in the central Red Sea to determine the relative effect of distance, depth, topography, time of day, wind, lunar phase, sea surface temperature and thermocline on detection probability. Detectability, as expected, declines with increasing distance between tags and receivers, and we find average detection ranges of 530 and 120 m, using V16 and V13 tags, respectively, but the topography of the reef can significantly modify this relationship, reducing the range by \textbackslashtextasciitilde70 \%, even when tags and receivers are in line-of-sight. Analyses that assume a relationship between distance and detections must therefore be used with care. Nighttime detection range was consistently reduced in both locations, and detections varied by lunar phase in the 4-month test, suggesting a strong influence of biological noise (reducing detection probability up to 30 \%), notably more influential than other environmental noises, including wind-driven noise, which is normally considered important in open-water environments. Analysis of detections should be corrected in consideration of the diel patterns we find, and range tests or sentinel tags should be used for more than 1 month to quantify potential changes due to lunar phase. Some studies assume that the most usual factor limiting detection range is weather-related noise; this cannot be extrapolated to coral reefs.},

  journal = {Journal of Animal Ecology}, 
  abstract = {Accurately describing animal space use is vital to understanding how wildlife use habitat. Improvements in GPS technology continue to facilitate collection of telemetry data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Application of the recently introduced dynamic Brownian bridge movement model (dBBMM) to such data is promising as the method explicitly incorporates the behavioural heterogeneity of a movement path into the estimated utilization distribution (UD).Utilization distributions defining space use are normally estimated for time-scales ranging from weeks to months, obscuring much of the fine-scale information available from high-volume GPS data sets. By accounting for movement heterogeneity, the dBBMM provides a rigorous, behaviourally based estimate of space use between each set of relocations. Focusing on UDs generated between individual sets of locations allows us to quantify fine-scale circadian variation in habitat use.We used the dBBMM to estimate UDs bounding individual time steps for three terrestrial species with different life histories to illustrate how the method can be used to identify fine-scale variations in habitat use. We also demonstrate how dBBMMs can be used to characterize circadian patterns of habitat selection and link fine-scale patterns of habitat use to behaviour.We observed circadian patterns of habitat use that varied seasonally for a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans). We found seasonal patterns in selection by the white-tailed deer and were able to link use of conifer forests and agricultural fields to behavioural state of the coyote. Additionally, we were able to quantify the date in which a Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) initiated laying as well as when during the day, she was most likely to visit the nest site to deposit eggs.The ability to quantify circadian patterns of habitat use may have important implications for research and management of wildlife. Additionally, the ability to link such patterns to behaviour may aid in the development of mechanistic models of habitat selection.},

  abstract = {For migrating land birds, the influence of extrinsic factors (e.g., weather and energetic condition) on stopover site selection relative to factors intrinsic to habitat (e.g., food) may be especially acute after crossing a large ecological barrier. We quantified bird distributions during spring and autumn migration along the coast of Mississippi after birds had crossed the Gulf of Mexico using weather surveillance radar data to test our prediction that bird distributions would be less closely associated with a proximate cue to intrinsic habitat quality (the amount of forest cover in the landscape) as proximity to the coastline increased during spring. Relative bird density was positively associated with the amount of hardwood forest in the landscape during both seasons, and broadly with proximity to the coastline during spring. In spring, bird density was less closely associated with the amount of hardwood forest with greater proximity to the coast. Due to extrinsic constraints associated with crossing the Gulf of Mexico during spring, most migrants appear to select sites for resting within 18 km from the coastline during their initial landfall and seek resource-rich habitats for refueling further inland during subsequent stopovers. During autumn, most birds seek resource-rich stopover sites inland from the coast in which to refuel before crossing the Gulf of Mexico. Because stopover habitat may be limiting to some populations of migratory land birds, the disproportionately high rates of human development and deforestation along with the reduced availability and amount of protection of forests in near-coastal areas create urgency for the conservation of forested stopover sites along the Gulf of Mexico.},

By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator–prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations.

Historically, MPAs alone have been considered ineffective for the protection of highly mobile species, because MPAs are unlikely to cover the range of a highly mobile species for a sufficient proportion of time. Recent studies, however, have shown MPAs to be successful in the protection of certain mobile species. The majority and most successful of these examples tend to focus on tropical reef species because there is currently a lack of understanding about mobile species from temperate climates. Questions therefore remain regarding their success for the wide ranging and migratory species found in temperate regions. We reviewed the relevant literature and discuss the critical factors that should be considered during MPA designation, but focus on how these relate to highly mobile fish species in particular. We use examples from both tropical and temperate regions to illustrate how current knowledge can be a useful starting point in MPA design where information is lacking. We conclude that using studies from tropical waters can fill some gaps in scientific data for some temperate species, but that scientific evidence is crucial to MPA success in temperate areas.},

  abstract = {Many animal species segregate by sex. Such segregation may be social in nature, or ecological, or both. Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), like many large mammals, are sexually size dimorphic. In size dimorphic species, allometric differences in morphology, metabolic rate and reproductive costs are likely. Such differences may require the sexes to use different foraging strategies or different habitats. To investigate sexual segregation of habitat in grey seals, we used satellite tracks from 95 (male 46; female 49) adults breeding at Sable Island, Nova Scotia (44 degrees N, 60 degrees W) collected from 1995 to 2005. Location estimates were made from satellite fixes using a state-space movement model to estimate true locations and regularize them in time. Location estimates were used to calculate home range kernels of male and female habitat use each month. Month by sex kernel home ranges revealed striking differences and dynamics in habitat use between males and females on spatial scales broader than most terrestrial examples and at temporal and spatial resolutions rarely available for marine species. Differences were most pronounced just before (October-December) and immediately after breeding (February-March). During both periods, males primarily used areas along the continental shelf break, while females mainly used mid-shelf regions. Coupled with previously identified sex-specific seasonal patterns of energy storage, diving and diet, our findings suggest that males and females differ profoundly in their spatial foraging strategies. These differences may serve to maximize fitness by reducing intersexual competition during key foraging periods.},

  abstract = {Electronic tagging of marine fishes is commonly achieved with archival tags that rely on light levels and sea surface temperatures to retrospectively estimate movements. However, methodological issues associated with light‐level geolocation have constrained meaningful inference to species where it is possible to accurately estimate time of sunrise and sunset. Most studies have largely ignored the oceanographic profiles collected by the tag as a potential way to refine light‐level geolocation estimates. Open‐source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high‐resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. The R package HMMoce leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. HMMoce exhibited as much as six‐fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light‐level geolocation approaches. The results demonstrated the general applicability of HMMoce to marine animals, particularly those that do not frequent surface waters during crepuscular periods.},

  journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Electronic tagging of marine fishes is commonly achieved with archival tags that rely on light levels and sea surface temperatures to retrospectively estimate movements. However, methodological issues associated with light‐level geolocation have constrained meaningful inference to species where it is possible to accurately estimate time of sunrise and sunset. Most studies have largely ignored the oceanographic profiles collected by the tag as a potential way to refine light‐level geolocation estimates. Open‐source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high‐resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. The R package HMMoce leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. HMMoce exhibited as much as six‐fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light‐level geolocation approaches. The results demonstrated the general applicability of HMMoce to marine animals, particularly those that do not frequent surface waters during crepuscular periods.},

Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry – movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach – which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences.2We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime.3To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods.4Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95\% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50\%.5Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods.6The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes.7We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

  journal = {Continental Shelf Research}, 
  abstract = { Habitat mapping is an important tool for marine spatial planning and is required for most ecosystem-based management approaches. The Firth of Lorn Special Area of Conservation (SAC), west Scotland, was originally designated for its rocky reef habitat but it is also an area of high importance for the Flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) and Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Here we present an improved predictive habitat map for the SAC utilising multibeam backscatter and bathymetry data collected as part of the Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland Hydrographic Survey Project. Backscatter, bathymetry and bathymetric derivatives were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and acoustic signatures were created from drop-down video habitat location data. A predictive habitat map was created from Maximum Likelihood Classification using the PCA. Dominant habitat types identified included; moderate energy circalittoral rock (CR.MCR), sublittoral mixed sediment (SS.SMx) and sublittoral sand and muddy sand (SS.SSa). Drop down video showed variable accuracy with 0–100\% correctly classified habitats due to the small sample size. The initial validation points were added and the model was rerun. In areas with no previous sea truthing points, some predictions changed to SS.SMx at depths > 100 m and SS.SSa in depths < 50 m, suggesting that the model can be improved with a greater depth-range of sea truthing data. Modern acoustic surveys undertaken for other purposes, such as navigational charting, can thus be used to generate broad-scale predictive habitat maps in a cost and time effective manner. Such maps have the potential for a wide range of use by marine stakeholders, in particular, for establishing environmental baselines for long term monitoring of benthic habitats. Given the high costs of surveying, such an approach supports the rationale of “Collect once and use many times”.},

There is some support for the hypothesis that carcharhinid species that complete their life-cycle within coral reef ecosystems, hereafter referred to as “reef sharks”, are more abundant inside no-take marine reserves due to a reduction in fishing pressure (i.e., they benefit from marine reserves). Key predictions of this hypothesis are that (a) individual reef sharks exhibit high site-fidelity to these protected areas and (b) their relative abundance will generally be higher in these areas compared to fished reefs. To test this hypothesis for the first time in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems we combined acoustic monitoring and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to measure reef shark site-fidelity and relative abundance, respectively. We focused on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), the most common reef shark in the Western Atlantic, at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve (GRMR), Belize. Acoustically tagged sharks (N = 34) were detected throughout the year at this location and exhibited strong site-fidelity. Shark presence or absence on 200 BRUVs deployed at GRMR and three other sites (another reserve site and two fished reefs) showed that the factor “marine reserve” had a significant positive effect on reef shark presence. We rejected environmental factors or site-environment interactions as predominant drivers of this pattern. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can benefit reef shark populations and we suggest new hypotheses to determine the underlying mechanism(s) involved: reduced fishing mortality or enhanced prey availability.},

Tag-bearing animals will be used as autonomous ocean profilers to enhance sparse oceanographic observations for vast ocean regions. These autonomous ocean samplers will provide unprecedented coverage of the water column structure of the North Pacific.

Twenty target species, including tunas, sharks, pinnipeds, cetaceans, seabirds, and marine turtles, will be monitored with electronic tags. Animal-collected oceanic data will be assimilated into global ocean databases, complement traditional methodologies and be used to help validate nearshore, regional, and basin scale ocean models. As more environmental information is gathered and delivered from the tagged animals, new insights will be obtained about their individual behaviors, as well as how diverse species have separately evolved to forage, reproduce, and survive in the vast pelagic environment.

Here, we focus on telemetry of aquatic species (marine mammals, sharks, fish, sea birds and turtles) and so are concerned with animal movements and behavior as they move through and above the world’s oceans, coastal rivers, estuaries and great lakes. Animal telemetry devices (“tags”) yield detailed data regarding animal responses to the coupled ocean–atmosphere and physical environment through which they are moving. Animal telemetry has matured and we describe a developing US Animal Telemetry Network (ATN) observing system that monitors aquatic life on a range of temporal and spatial scales that will yield both short- and long-term benefits, fill oceanographic observing and knowledge gaps and advance many of the U.S. National Ocean Policy Priority Objectives. ATN has the potential to create a huge impact for the ocean observing activities undertaken by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and become a model for establishing additional national-level telemetry networks worldwide. Telemetry can provide environmental, behavioral and physiological data in near-real time, or by use of archival tags in which the data are stored or later transmitted to satellites. Aquatic animal species tagged have ranged from 6-g salmon smolts to 150-ton whales. Detailed observations of animal movements and behavior in relation to critical habitats in their aquatic environment have significantly improved our understanding of ecosystem function and dynamics. These observations are critical for sustaining populations, conserving biodiversity and implementing ecosystem-based management through an increased understanding of ecosystem structures, functions, and processes, as well as their importance to ecosystem services and values. Sensors carried by tagged animals have come of age and deliver high-resolution physical oceanographic data at relatively low costs. Animals are particularly adept at helping scientists identify critical habitats, spawning locations, and important oceanographic features (e.g., fronts, eddies and upwelling areas). They also provide important insights into regions of the oceans that are difficult and expensive to monitor (e.g., offshore environments, Arctic). This paper focuses on how to integrate an operational ATN into U.S. IOOS. The development of U.S. IOOS initially focused on the acquisition and integration of physical and chemical oceanographic data. With this system now operational, U.S. IOOS is ready to add the acquisition of relevant biological observations, and to enhance the acquisition of physical and chemical oceanographic observations via ATN platforms. A U.S. ATN observing system that monitors aquatic life on a range of temporal and spatial scales could yield both short- and long-term benefits, fill oceanographic observing and knowledge gaps, and advance many of the National Ocean Policy Priority Objectives.

  abstract = {Bayesian state-space movement models have been proposed as a method of inferring behavioural states from movement paths (Morales et al. 2004), thereby providing insight into the behavioural processes from which patterns of animal space use arise in heterogeneous environments. It is not clear, however, how effective state-space models are at estimating behavioural states. We use stochastic simulations of two movement models to quantify how behavioural state movement characteristics affect classification error. State-space movement models can be a highly effective approach to estimating behavioural states from movement paths. Classification accuracy was contingent upon the degree of separation between the distributions that characterize the states (e.g. step length and turn angle distributions) and the relative frequency of the behavioural states. In the best case scenarios classification accuracy approached 100\%, but was close to 0\% when step length and turn angle distributions of each state were similar, or when one state was rare. Mean classification accuracy was uncorrelated with path length, but the variance in classification accuracy was inversely related to path length. Importantly, we find that classification accuracy can be predicted based on the separation between distributions that characterize the movement paths, thereby providing a method of estimating classification accuracy for real movement paths. We demonstrate this approach using radiotelemetry relocation data of 34 moose (Alces alces). We conclude that Bayesian state-space models offer powerful new opportunities for inferring behavioural states from relocation data.},

We begin by offering a brief summary of the pioneering work in shark field physiology (ca. 1960), the technologies used to track and log physiological data in the field, and how field work can expand and enhance the knowledge gained in the laboratory. The chapter then proceeds to offer a more detailed account of how field and laboratory work have offered a better understanding of the thermal biology of sharks and rays, and provides examples of work showing the use of behavior and some of the physiological mechanisms that elasmobranchs can utilize to alter the rates of key physiological parameters. Because most sharks and rays are highly mobile, we then address how field work has been used to study their swimming kinematics, bioenergetics, and their feeding ecology. This is followed by a case study on how field work has given an unprecedented glimpse into the biology, ecology, and physiology of the thresher sharks, a unique group of sharks for which most prior information was obtained from dead specimens that were captured incidentally by fishermen. While the logistical difficulties surrounding field work with sharks and rays has often lead to scenarios where only a few specimens were studied, the development of new and lower cost technologies and the use of better techniques for handling sharks in the wild will allow the recording of more physiological and environmental variables and allow access to a higher number of species, even in places thought to be inaccessible in the past.},

  abstract = {Search behavior is often used as a proxy for foraging effort within studies of animal movement, despite it being only one part of the foraging process, which also includes prey capture. While methods for validating prey capture exist, many studies rely solely on behavioral annotation of animal movement data to identify search and infer prey capture attempts. However, the degree to which search correlates with prey capture is largely untested. This study applied seven behavioral annotation methods to identify search behavior from GPS tracks of northern gannets (Morus bassanus), and compared outputs to the occurrence of dives recorded by simultaneously deployed time–depth recorders. We tested how behavioral annotation methods vary in their ability to identify search behavior leading to dive events. There was considerable variation in the number of dives occurring within search areas across methods. Hidden Markov models proved to be the most successful, with 81\% of all dives occurring within areas identified as search. k‐Means clustering and first passage time had the highest rates of dives occurring outside identified search behavior. First passage time and hidden Markov models had the lowest rates of false positives, identifying fewer search areas with no dives. All behavioral annotation methods had advantages and drawbacks in terms of the complexity of analysis and ability to reflect prey capture events while minimizing the number of false positives and false negatives. We used these results, with consideration of analytical difficulty, to provide advice on the most appropriate methods for use where prey capture behavior is not available. This study highlights a need to critically assess and carefully choose a behavioral annotation method suitable for the research question being addressed, or resulting species management frameworks established. Using the timing of known prey capture events, we deploy a range of search metrics from movement data to determine how well different methods of search prediction capture foraging. We provide recommendations based upon the study questions and stress the need for hypothesis‐driven research in movement ecology.},

  abstract = {Flapper skates (Dipturus intermedius) were once widespread in European shelf waters but are currently classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to historical overexploitation. Novel monitoring approaches are needed to assess the efficacy of management measures, such as dedicated marine protected areas, for the conservation of relict skate populations. Flapper skates possess distinctive dorsal spot patterns, which could potentially be used for individual recognition using photo‐identification (photo‐ID) approaches. This study assessed the potential of photo‐ID as a method for individual recognition of a relict population of skates within a dedicated marine protected area in western Scotland (UK), which has long been targeted by directed recreational angling. A collection of 486 photographs of 373 separate skate capture events from 2011 to 2016, taken with standard mobile phones and compact cameras, was studied using visual pairwise comparison methods to determine number of individuals and recapture rates. Results indicated that adult flapper skates were individually recognizable with a high degree of certainty through comparison of spot patterns, assuming appropriate lighting conditions. A total of 226 individuals were identified, of which 77 (34\%) were recaptured at least once. The average recapture interval was 308 days (SE: 29.4 days), with the longest recapture interval to date being 4.4 years. Spot patterns among recaptured tagged or otherwise uniquely identifiable skates were found to remain stable over timescales of months to >1 year. Results indicate that photo‐ID, based on photographs sourced through citizen science approaches, can provide a low‐cost alternative means of monitoring flapper skate presence and distribution for the purposes of underpinning management decisions.},

  author = {Benhamou, Simon}, 
  journal = {PLoS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution (UD) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, HR). One such method rests on Brownian bridges (BBs). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both HR settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis. I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge (BRB) and show that the MKDE method is a practical means to estimate UDs based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) BRBs. The equation governing BRBs is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the BB equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the BB method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their HRs and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency. Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks (BCRWs), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified BRBs proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate UDs from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.},

  abstract = {Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently.2Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean.3In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, ‘pseudo-experimental’ analyses of predator–prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as ‘replicates’, and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as ‘treatments’, are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise.4Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator–prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton.5Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control.6Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.},

Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance.

Although the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) is widely studied, most feeding studies have been conducted using invasive techniques, such as the analysis of stomach contents. Moreover, information from the Mediterranean Sea is surprisingly scarce and not up to date. Here, we studied the feeding ecology of the small-spotted catshark in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea using stable isotopes (nitrogen and carbon isotopic values) from blood samples, with individuals released alive in the area of capture after sampling. In overall for the population of small-spotted catshark, the isotopic values were −19.01 ± 1.12‰ and 8.03 ± 0.61‰ for δ13C and for δ15N, respectively. Results reveal a diet mainly composed of euphausiids, with sex and size variations. Results confirm the ecological role of the small-spotted catshark as a mesopredator, which holds a trophic position similar to skates and rays in the study area, but lower than the other demersal and pelagic sharks analysed. The trophic behaviour of the small-spotted catshark indicates its high trophic plasticity, which could allow this species to thrive in highly exploited environments. Our methodological approach, which did not damage the target species, presents new possibilities for conducting ecological studies with other elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea, a highly exploited area that hosts many threatened and rare species.},

  abstract = {Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are a common conservation strategy, these areas are often designed with little prior knowledge of the spatial behaviour of the species they are designed to protect. Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (∼14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of ∼250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.},

The movement patterns of broadnose sevengill sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, were monitored with acoustic and satellite technology in coastal areas of southeast Tasmania, Australia. Individuals were tagged in two habitats (Norfolk Bay and the Derwent Estuary) for which we had ecological information such as diet, population structure and abundance. Notorynchus cepedianus showed seasonal site fidelity in the use of the coastal habitats. The general pattern was for sharks to exit coastal areas over winter and females to return the following spring and males in summer. Their movement into these coastal areas coincided with high seasonal abundance of their known prey species during summer, suggesting feeding site fidelity. Individuals tagged in two coastal areas showed low spatial and dietary overlap, suggesting localized site fidelity and fine spatial scale resource partitioning. This has rarely been reported for large mobile predators. Both satellite and acoustic methods showed that males make northerly migrations during winter to distances of at least 1000km. The combined use of tracking, diet and abundance information demonstrated that N. cepedianus are likely to exert significant predation pressure on prey inhabiting these areas during summer. Overall, this study highlights the benefit of complementing movement data with other ecological information to understand the habitat use of large mobile predators and their potential influences on ecosystem structure and function.},

Subtle morphological aspects and bathymetric distribution are traits that vary among skate species that could have implications for their feeding ecology. We test how body size, snout length and bathymetric distribution influence the feeding habits and dietary niche breadth in skates using data on 71 species taken from the literature. We hypothesized that snout length has an effect on diet composition. We also hypothesized that dietary niche breadth increases with increasing depth range and decreases with increasing body size of skate species. Generalized additive models for location scale and shape were fitted with taxonomic level (genera nested within family) included as a random effect term in each model. A model selection approach to test the level of support for alternative models was applied. We found that skate species that forage on large prey have the largest body size and skate species with the smallest body size prey on small and medium-sized invertebrates. The results indicated that body size has an effect on feeding habits of skates, whereas an effect of snout length was not supported. Bathymetric variables have an effect on the diet of skates. Our prediction that dietary niche breadth increases with increasing depth range and decreases with increasing body size of skate species was supported in part: in a first phase the relationship between dietary niche breadth and body size is positive, then in a second phase, including species larger than 1000 mm total length, the relationship become negative.},

They, therefore, do not account for the variability of behavior of semiaquatic animals, and the switching between terrestrial and aquatic environments. This is the first study to use hidden Markov models (HMM) to divide dives of a semiaquatic animal into clusters and thus identify the environmental predictors of transition between behavioral modes. We used 18 existing data sets of the dives of 14 American mink (Neovison vison) fitted with time-depth recorders in lowland England. Using HMM, we identified 3 behavioral states (1, temporal cluster of dives; 2, more loosely aggregated diving within aquatic activity; and 3, terminal dive of a cluster or a single, isolated dive). Based on the higher than expected proportion of dives in State 1, we conclude that mink tend to dive in clusters. We found no relationship between temperature and the proportion of dives in each state or between temperature and the rate of transition between states, meaning that in our study area, mink are apparently not adopting different diving strategies at different temperatures. Transition analysis between states has shown that there is no correlation between ambient temperature and the likelihood of mink switching from one state to another, that is, changing foraging modes. The variables provided good discrimination and grouped into consistent states well, indicating promise for further application of HMM and other state transition analyses in studies of semiaquatic animals.},

Overall, 30 fish were tagged and released, and 104,170 highly precise (˜1–3 m) spatial positions were estimated during the 43-d study. To quantify gray triggerfish movements, we used a combination of exploratory data analyses and hidden Markov models (HMM), the latter of which can identify and elucidate normally hidden behavioral states. Both methods suggested gray triggerfish movements varied by diel period and among individuals, and that some of the variation among individuals could be explained by fish size. Depending on model specification, HMMs identified two or three behavioral states, one of which was likely resting that occurred mostly at night and another was likely foraging or transit that occurred mostly during the day. Moreover, resting at night occurred in small, discrete patches within the study area, whereas foraging or transit behaviors occurred broadly throughout the study area. We encourage a wider use of acoustic telemetry and HMMs to shed light on the normally hidden behaviors of demersal fishes.},

Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

Spectral analysis, linear mixed modelling, segmented regression and multivariate techniques were used to examine the effect of mean sea surface temperature (SST) and mixed layer depth on vertical movements. OWTs continually oscillated throughout the upper 200 m of the water column. In summer when the water column was stratified with high SSTs, oscillations increased in amplitude and cycle length and sharks reduced the time spent in the upper 50 m. In winter when the water column was cooler and well-mixed, oscillations decreased in amplitude and cycle length and sharks frequently occupied the upper 50 m. SSTs of 28 oC marked a distinct change in vertical movements and the onset of thermoregulation strategies. Our results have implications for the ecology of these animals in a warming ocean.},

In Elliott Bay, WA, sixgill sharks made direct vertical movements at sunrise and sunset, while vertical movements were more variable in deeper, main channel waters. The greatest rates of ascent and descent in sixgill sharks occurred most often during night-time ebb tides. Seasonally, sixgill sharks occupied deeper habitats during the autumn and winter than during spring and were most active in the autumn. We also found synchronous vertical movements in three of four shark pairs tracked simultaneously, evidence that these sharks were responding to similar stimuli. Clear and consistent patterns of diel activity throughout the year across size and sex of sharks and across multiple spatial scales is most consistent with the hypothesis that foraging behaviour is responsible for the patterns of diel vertical movement of sixgill sharks in Puget Sound.},

In this article, the particle filter is applied to geolocate Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea, leading to a representation of the results as probability distributions for each time step, thus giving an explicit representation of uncertainty. Furthermore, the method is used to estimate the magnitude of the error in the measurements by the tags and the swimming velocity of the fish. The average swimming velocity during a day was estimated to be around 0.20 ms1 for fish of \textbackslashtextasciitilde60cm length. The method is general and the presentation is formulated to facilitate implementation for different systems where other quantities are observed.},

  title = {{Bayesian State-Space Modelling of Conventional Acoustic Tracking Provides Accurate Descriptors of Home Range Behavior in a Small-Bodied Coastal Fish Species}}, 
  author = {Alós, Josep and Palmer, Miquel and Balle, Salvador and Arlinghaus, Robert}, 
  journal = {Plos One}, 
  abstract = {State-space models (SSM) are increasingly applied in studies involving biotelemetry-generated positional data because they are able to estimate movement parameters from positions that are unobserved or have been observed with non-negligible observational error. Popular telemetry systems in marine coastal fish consist of arrays of omnidirectional acoustic receivers, which generate a multivariate time-series of detection events across the tracking period. Here we report a novel Bayesian fitting of a SSM application that couples mechanistic movement properties within a home range (a specific case of random walk weighted by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) with a model of observational error typical for data obtained from acoustic receiver arrays. We explored the performance and accuracy of the approach through simulation modelling and extensive sensitivity analyses of the effects of various configurations of movement properties and time-steps among positions. Model results show an accurate and unbiased estimation of the movement parameters, and in most cases the simulated movement parameters were properly retrieved. Only in extreme situations (when fast swimming speeds are combined with pooling the number of detections over long time-steps) the model produced some bias that needs to be accounted for in field applications. Our method was subsequently applied to real acoustic tracking data collected from a small marine coastal fish species, the pearly razorfish, Xyrichtys novacula. The Bayesian SSM we present here constitutes an alternative for those used to the Bayesian way of reasoning. Our Bayesian SSM can be easily adapted and generalized to any species, thereby allowing studies in freely roaming animals on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of home ranges and territory establishment, both in fishes and in other taxa.},

  title = {{Consistent Selection towards Low Activity Phenotypes When Catchability Depends on Encounters among Human Predators and Fish}}, 
  author = {Alós, Josep and Palmer, Miquel and Arlinghaus, Robert}, 
  journal = {PLoS ONE}, 
  abstract = {Together with life-history and underlying physiology, the behavioural variability among fish is one of the three main trait axes that determines the vulnerability to fishing. However, there are only a few studies that have systematically investigated the strength and direction of selection acting on behavioural traits. Using in situ fish behaviour revealed by telemetry techniques as input, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that simulated the Lagrangian trajectory of prey (fish) moving within a confined home range (HR). Fishers exhibiting various prototypical fishing styles targeted these fish in the model. We initially hypothesised that more active and more explorative individuals would be systematically removed under all fished conditions, in turn creating negative selection differentials on low activity phenotypes and maybe on small HR. Our results partly supported these general predictions. Standardised selection differentials were, on average, more negative on HR than on activity. However, in many simulation runs, positive selection pressures on HR were also identified, which resulted from the stochastic properties of the fishes’ movement and its interaction with the human predator. In contrast, there was a consistent negative selection on activity under all types of fishing styles. Therefore, in situations where catchability depends on spatial encounters between human predators and fish, we would predict a consistent selection towards low activity phenotypes and have less faith in the direction of the selection on HR size. Our study is the first theoretical investigation on the direction of fishery-induced selection of behaviour using passive fishing gears. The few empirical studies where catchability of fish was measured in relation to passive fishing techniques, such as gill-nets, traps or recreational fishing, support our predictions that fish in highly exploited situations are, on average, characterised by low swimming activity, stemming, in part, from negative selection on swimming activity.},

  abstract = {Harvesting of wild-living animals is often intensive and may selectively target heritable behavioral traits. We studied the exploitation dynamics and the vulnerability consequences of individual heterogeneity in movement-related behaviors in free-ranging pearly razorfish (Xyrichthys novacula). Using underwater-video recording, we firstly document a fast and high exploitation rate of about 60\% of the adult population removed in just few days after the opening of the season. Subsequently, we tagged a sample of individuals with acoustic transmitters and studied whether behavioral traits were significant predictors of the vulnerability to angling. Tagged individuals revealed repeatable behaviors in several home range-related traits, suggesting the presence of spatial behavioral types. The individuals surviving the experimental fishery showed only localized and low-intensity movement patterns. Our study provides new insights for understanding the harvesting pressures and selective properties acting on behavioral traits of recreational fishing. Many fish stocks around the globe are today predominantly exploited by recreational fisheries. The fisheries-induced change in fish behavior described here may be therefore widespread, and has the potential to alter food-webs, profitability of the fisheries and to affect stock assessment by eroding catchability in the long-term.},

  journal = {Harmful Algae}, 
  abstract = {Fjordic coastlines provide sheltered locations for finfish and shellfish aquaculture, and are often subject to harmful algal blooms (HABs) some of which develop offshore and are then advected to impact nearshore aquaculture. Numerical models are a potentially important tool for providing early warning of such HAB events. However, the complex topography of fjordic shelf regions is a significant challenge to modelling. This is frequently compounded by complex bathymetry and local weather patterns. Existing structured grid models do not provide the resolution needed to represent these coastlines in their wider shelf context. In a number of locations advectively transported blooms of the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi are of particular concern for the finfish industry. Here were present a novel hydrodynamic model of the coastal waters to the west of Scotland that is based on unstructured finite volume methodology, providing a sufficiently high resolution hydrodynamical structure to realistically simulate the transport of particles (such as K. mikimotoi cells) within nearshore waters where aquaculture sites are sited. Model–observation comparisons reveal close correspondence of tidal elevations for major semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. The thermohaline structure of the model and its current fields are also in good agreement with a number of existing observational datasets. Simulations of the transport of Lagrangian drifting buoys, along with the incorporation of an individual-based biological model, based on a bloom of K. mikimotoi, demonstrate that unstructured grid models have considerable potential for HAB prediction in Scotland and in complex topographical regions elsewhere.},

Using TMB, we are able to estimate additional parameters compared to previous methods, all without requiring a substantial increase in computational time.

Compared with chicks reared by non‐handled adults that did not carry tags, deployment of tags on one or both adult parents ultimately resulted in 35\% reduction in chick body mass and significantly reduced chick skeletal size preceding fledging (19 April). However, body mass between chick groups was not significantly different after controlling for skeletal size. Effects on chicks were more pronounced in six pairs where both parents carried tags. Chick mass was negatively related to the duration that adults carried tags. In this study, none of the chicks reared by pairs where both parents were tagged, 54\% of chicks reared by pairs where one parent was tagged, and 83\% of chicks reared by non‐handled and non‐tagged parents achieved a previously determined pre‐fiedging mass threshold (564 g; Sagar \& Horning 1998). Body mass of adults carrying tags and returning from trans‐equatorial migration the following year were 4\% lighter on average than non‐tagged birds, but this difference was not statistically significant. Reduced mass among chicks reared by adults carrying tags during the chick‐provisioning period indicated that adults altered “normal” provisioning behaviours to maintain their own body condition at the expense of their chicks. Population‐level information derived from telemetry studies can reveal important habitat‐linked behaviours, unique aspects of sea‐bird foraging behaviours, and migration ecology. Information for some species (e.g., overlap with fisheries) can aid conservation and marine ecosystem management. We advise caution, however, when interpreting certain data related to adult provisioning behaviours (e.g., time spent foraging, provisioning rates, etc.). If effects on individuals are of concern, we suggest shorter‐term deployments, smaller and lighter tags, and alternative attachment techniques, especially when investigating threatened or endangered species.},

Here we evaluated the movement dynamics of a highly migratory apex predatory shark (tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) at the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). Using data from satellite tracking passive acoustic telemetry, and stereo baited remote underwater video, we estimated residency, activity spaces, site fidelity, distributional abundances and migration patterns from the GMR and in relation to nesting beaches of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), a seasonally abundant and predictable prey source for large tiger sharks. Tiger sharks exhibited a high degree of philopatry, with 93\% of the total satellite-tracked time across all individuals occurring within the GMR. Large sharks (> 200 cm TL) concentrated their movements in front of the two most important green sea turtle-nesting beaches in the GMR, visiting them on a daily basis during nocturnal hours. In contrast, small sharks (< 200 cm TL) rarely visited turtle-nesting areas and displayed diurnal presence at a third location where only immature sharks were found. Small and some large individuals remained in the three study areas even outside of the turtle-nesting season. Only two sharks were satellite-tracked outside of the GMR, and following long-distance migrations, both individuals returned to turtle-nesting beaches at the subsequent turtle-nesting season. The spatial patterns of residency and site fidelity of tiger sharks suggest that the presence of a predictable source of prey and suitable habitats might reduce the spatial extent of this large shark that is highly migratory in other parts of its range. This highly philopatric behaviour enhances the potential effectiveness of the GMR for their protection.},

  abstract = { Bigeye tuna are targeted by longliners and caught incidentally by purse seiners in the tropical Pacific. The spawning biomass has been reduced significantly from unexploited levels, necessitating management action in both the western and central Pacific and eastern Pacific. Stock assessments of bigeye tuna rely primarily on data from the fisheries; however, the vulnerability of the stock to these gears, and its spatiotemporal variability, remains poorly understood, requiring simplifying assumptions to be made in the stock assessments. We analyzed the vertical behavior of 65 bigeye tuna (estimated size range 48–130 cm fork length) tracked with archival tags in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Coral Sea, and found that fish depth shows a clear gradient with longitude, becoming progressively shallower from west to east. Additive mixed models were used to explore potential relationships of the depth behavior during both day and night to several life history and environmental variables. Swimming depths were most clearly related to the thermocline depth, the intensity of temperature stratification of the water column and fish size. The model predictions suggest strong relationships between fish depth and fisheries catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) both spatially and temporally. In particular, we propose that El Niño-Southern Oscillation-driven changes in oceanography have a major influence on fish depth and longline CPUE, which could have substantial implications for stock assessments where longline CPUE is used as an index of abundance.},

  journal = {Ecography}, 
  abstract = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

 long-term records of ambient temperature from Paci®c

 diel patterns of descents to deeper, cooler water and
 ascents   to   the   surface.   Fish   were   found   at   higher
 average temperatures at night, with narrower temper-
 ature ranges and fewer descents than during the day.
 Fish   tagged   in   the   Gulf   of   Alaska   were   at   higher
 temperatures   on   average   (10±12°C)   than   chum   sal-
 mon   tagged   in   the   Bering   Sea   (8±10°C).   Chum salmon were also found at a wider range of tempera-
 tures ()1±22°C vs 5±15°C). This is probably related
 both   to   the   different   oceanographic   regions   through
 which the ®sh migrated, as well as species differences
 in thermal range and vertical movements. Proportions
 of time that individual ®sh spent at different temper-
 atures  seemed to vary among oceanographic regions.
 Steelhead   trout   may   descend   to   moderate   depths
 (50 m) and not be limited to the top few metres, as
 had  been   believed.  Japanese   chum   salmon   may   seek
 deep,   cold   waters   as   they   encounter   warm   surface
 temperatures   on   their   homeward   migrations.   Tem-
 perature data from all ®sh showed an initial period (4±
 21 days) of day and night temperatures near those of
 sea surface temperatures, suggesting a period of recu-
 peration   from   tagging   trauma.   A   period   of   tagging
 recuperation   suggests   that   vertical   movement   data
 from short-term ultrasonic telemetry studies may not
 represent normal behaviour of ®sh. The considerable
 diurnal   and   shorter-term   variation   in   ambient   tem-
 peratures suggests that offshore ocean distribution may
 be linked more to prey distribution and foraging than
 to sea surface temperatures.},

  author = {undefined, and undefined, and undefined, and undefined, and undefined, and undefined, and undefined,}, 
  journal = {Marine Ecology Progress Series}, 
  abstract = {Wild fish were counted in 4 depth-related strata (bottom, midwater, cage and surface)
 around 3 floating sea-cage fish farms (Altea, Campello, Guardamar) along the Spanish coastline and
 2 farms (Los Cristianos, San Andrés) in the Canary Islands. Almost 200000 wild fish belonging to
 53 species  were  seen;  representatives  of  Sparidae  (8  species),  Carangidae  (6  species),  Mugilidae
 (5 species) and Chondrichthyid rays (7 species) were commonly observed. At all 5 farms, 1 to 3 taxa
 accounted  for  >74\%  of  the  abundance  and  >94\%  of  the  biomass  of  aggregated  wild  fish.  Abun-
 dances  (5.7  to  162  times)  and  biomasses  (42  to  1728  times)  of  wild  fish  were  higher  in  the  cage 
 stratum at the 3 Mediterranean farms than at the bottom. In contrast, abundances and biomasses of
 wild fish at the Canary Island farms were highest at the bottom at San Andrés and highest at the sur-
 face at Los Cristianos. Large differences in the sizes of associated fish existed among farms, with low
 percentages of fish >20 cm total length at Guardamar, Los Cristianos and San Andrés (11 to 25\%)
 compared to Altea and Campello (81 to 95\%). However, the greatest proportions of large fish were
 present in the cage stratum at each of the 5 farms. This variability suggests that assemblage structure
 and aggregated biomass of wild fish at farms cannot be predicted prior to their installation, causing
 uncertainty in modelling of nutrient dispersal. Further, the sedimentation ‘footprint’ of temperate sea-
 cage  fish  farms  may  vary  depending  on  (1)  the  species  and  biomass  of  associated  wild  fish,  and
 (2) where these fish are distributed in the water column. As wild fish consume lost feed and assimi-
 late nutrients, we suggest that coastal managers prohibit fishing of large planktivorous species at
 farms to fully harness their ability to ameliorate benthic impacts.},

	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoen-vironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter δ15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-Sϕ, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

 abstract = {
In this paper, we discuss an extension to two popular approaches to modeling complex structures in ecological data: the generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the \textbf{mgcv} package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.
