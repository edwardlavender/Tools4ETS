  author = {Gibson, R N}, 
  journal = {Hydrobiologica}, 
  abstract = {Many shallow-water organisms are subjected to regular, frequent and considerable changes in their environment
 imposed by the tides. Such changes range from complex alterations in local conditions, as in the intertidal zone,
 to simpler variations in current speed and direction offshore. To take advantage of the opportunities these changes
 provide, many animals undertake regular vertical and/or horizontal migratory movements in synchrony with the
 tidal cycle. Others use tidal currents selectively for transport to new habitats. Such movements vary in extent from a
 few mm to several km and may be modulated by the diel cycle of light intensity. This paper reviews the existence of
 tidal migration in marine animals from various taxa and habitats. Crustacean and sh examples illustrate the various
 functions of tidal migration, including transport, feeding, predator avoidance and reproduction. These functions are
 not necessarily mutually exclusive and may change throughout ontogeny. The mechanisms involved in migration
 are discussed in terms of direct reactions to environmental stimuli and the interaction of these responses with
 endogenous rhythms of activity and responsiveness.},

The system process is often a function of the demographic parameters of interest, such as survival probabilities, transition rates between states, and/or abundance, whereas the model parameters associated with the observation process are conditional on the underlying state of the system.

The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus.

Prime among these findings was the discovery that, occasionally, one of the two daily peaks in an organism's rhythm assumed a different period from its partner. Similar results have since been observed in a host of different organisms. These data led to the circalunidian-clock hypothesis that envisions two basic 24.8 h clocks, coupled together in antiphase, as the driving force for these rhythms. There is, however, only a slight difference (50 minutes) in running times between a solar-day clock with a period of approximately 24 h and a lunar-day clock with a period of approximately 24.8 h, both of which display “circa” periods that overlap.

Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur ‘travelling’ costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate ‘activity seascapes’, which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.},

In this paper, we discuss an extension to two popular approaches to modeling complex structures in ecological data: the generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the \textbf{mgcv} package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

  author = {Pinto, Cecilia and Spezia, Luigi}, 
  journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Time series of animal movement obtained from bio-loggers are becoming widely used across all taxa. These data are nowadays of high quality, combining high resolution with precision, as the tags are able to collect for longer times and store larger quantities of data. Due to their nature, high-frequency data sequences often pose non-trivial problems in time series analysis: nonlinearity, non-normality, non-stationarity and long memory. These issues can be tackled by modelling the data sequence as a realization of a stochastic regime-switching process. We suggest a novel Markov switching autoregressive model where the hidden Markov chain is non-homogeneous, with time-varying transition probabilities, whose dynamics depend on the dynamics of some contemporary categorical covariates. To illustrate the use of the method, we apply it to the depth profiles of four individuals of flapper skate (Dipturus cf. intermedia) in order to identify swimming behaviours. Individual time series were obtained from data storage tags that recorded pressure every two minutes. The environmental covariates used were lunar phase (a proxy for the spring-neap tidal cycle), lunar cycle and diel cycle. For all individuals, two states (or regimes) were always selected (the autoregressive order was either three or four), representing different regimes of animal activity, that is state 1 for resting or horizontal swimming or slow vertical movement and state 2 for fast ascending and descending. The cycle of the four lunar phases was the only environmental covariate that explained the hidden state dynamics in all individuals, whereas lunar cycle was selected for two individuals and diel cycle for one only. The method is an efficient approach to fit one-dimensional tag data using categorical environmental covariates, and to classify the observations into a small number of states representing individual behaviours of tagged individuals.},

Research has shown fluctuations in the environment (abiotic factors) can trigger movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use for many elasmobranch species. Most studies to date have selectively focused on a small number of abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, salinity); however, other factors such as dissolved oxygen, tide, photoperiod, barometric pressure and pH have also been documented to act as drivers of movement in shark and ray species. Although usually examined individually, abiotic factors rarely act in isolation and often differ in their level of influence between species, sex, ontogenetic stage, season and geographic location. This paper reviews the role of abiotic factors as a driver of movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use in elasmobranchs.

  journal = {Journal of Sea Research}, 
  abstract = {Correspondence between patterns of occupied depth and environmental cycles, called “depth-specific periodic behavior”, has been used to inform management of several flatfishes. However, little is known about depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), an important species in recreational, commercial and subsistence fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. To evaluate depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut, an approach was developed in which depth data from electronic tags were used to produce four types of complementary plots, including two-dimensional time series of depth, activity level derived from differencing adjacent depth recordings, periodograms, and wavelet transform coefficients. From a visual examination of the plots, daily depth-specific periodic behavior types, including diel, tidal, spawning, semi-lunar and lunar, were assigned to 37 individual Pacific halibut. Overall, the approach used in this study was useful for describing relatively short term depth-specific periodic behavior, but was less informative for understanding relatively long term behavioral patterns. The results suggest that patterns in occupied depth may be related to seasonal activities of Pacific halibut. Specifically, during the summer feeding season, fish most commonly behaved periodically on a diel scale or inactively laid on the seafloor, which was manifested as tidal periodicity as the height of the water column fluctuated above the fish. Both active swimming and inactivity on the seafloor may be related to different foraging strategies. During fall and spring migratory periods and the winter spawning season, no periodicity in depth-specific behavior was most common, which may correspond to directed movement over irregular bathymetry between feeding and spawning locations or to reproductive behaviors. Evidence of an additional reproductive behavior, spawning rises off the seafloor, was also observed during the winter spawning season. This approach for understanding the periodicity of occupied depth of Pacific halibut provides additional insight into the behavior of this iconic species. This knowledge perhaps may be used in the future to inform this species' management, such as refining estimates of susceptibility to capture and examining timing of movement among regulatory areas.},

In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoen-vironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter δ15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-Sϕ, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

However, this information is not available for the majority of marine species and is difficult to obtain for those with low population densities. The common skate, Dipturus batis, was once abundant and widespread in the North-East Atlantic but is now thought to be locally extinct in the Irish Sea and in the central and southern North Sea, and is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The constraints of skate body morphology on locomotory mode assume low levels of activity with long periods spent resting on the seabed, therefore predicting a high degree of site fidelity. To investigate this hypothesis we tagged 8 common skate (two male and six female, mass range: 10.9–63.5 kg) with depth and temperature-logging data storage tags off the west coast of Scotland in May 2008. All 6 tags attached to females were recovered after 1–9 months at liberty. All 6 individuals exhibited pronounced site fidelity to highly localised areas. Within these local areas however, time-depth profiles were dominated by periods of high activity, with vertical movements of >100 m being conducted on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. Intra-individual plasticity was observed in vertical activity patterns with individuals switching between low and high activity patterns. Smaller skate were generally less active and occupied deeper depths. Limited short-term horizontal movements in preferred habitats supporting apparently high foraging activity highlights the need for spatial management of ‘refugial’ populations of this once widespread fish, that appears now largely extirpated from European waters.},

Although reduced in size recently, over 2000 stations have at some time been part of the network, resulting in some 10 million measurements. Modelling at a daily scale is desirable for accurate trend estimation and mapping, and to provide daily exposure estimates for epidemiological cohort studies. Because of the data set size, previous work has focussed on modelling time or space averages pollution levels, but this is unsatisfactory from a health perspective, since it is often acute exposure locally and on the time scale of days that is of most importance in driving adverse health outcomes. If computed by conventional means our black smoke model would require a half terabyte of storage just for the model matrix, whereas we are able to compute with it on a desktop workstation. The best previously available reduced memory footprint method would have required three orders of magnitude more computing time than our new method.},

 abstract = { Ecologists traditionally regard time as part of the background against which ecological interactions play out. In this book, Eric Post argues that time should be treated as a resource used by organisms for growth, maintenance, and offspring production. Post uses insights from phenology-the study of the timing of life-cycle events-to present a theoretical framework of time in ecology that casts long-standing observations in the field in an entirely new light. Combining conceptual models with field data, he demonstrates how phenological advances, delays, and stasis, documented in an array of taxa, can all be viewed as adaptive components of an organism's strategic use of time. Post shows how the allocation of time by individual organisms to critical life history stages is not only a response to environmental cues but also an important driver of interactions at the population, species, and community levels. To demonstrate the applications of this exciting new conceptual framework, Time in Ecology uses meta-analyses of previous studies as well as Post's original data on the phenological dynamics of plants, caribou, and muskoxen in Greenland.},

ABSTRACT={The need for long-term studies to understand ecological dynamics is widely recognized but has not been satisfactorily addressed to date. The development of “long-term” (LT) observatories has aimed to improve the situation, but the main handicaps are that we should wait for generations to yield reliable results and that a number of ecological processes occurring at time scales larger than centuries will not be fully resolved. Palaeoecology can provide the needed time scale for true long-term ecology, but it is limited by the ability to merge ecological, and palaeoecological data into continuous time series. This paper suggests a practical way of attaining such goals based on the concept of time continuum. A short review is provided on the main handicaps for palaeoecological records to be incorporated into current ecological datasets and the recent improvements in the field. A global network of past-present-future ecological observatories (PPFEO) centered around lakes with annually-laminated sediments could act as a means of producing truly long-term and continuous ecological records by combining high-resolution palaeoecological techniques with ecological methods commonly used in LT observatories.}

abstract = {Summary Hundreds of studies have evaluated the dynamics of plant invasions and their impacts on native plant communities and ecosystem functions, but most are limited in duration to only one or a few years. As such, we have a poor understanding of how invader dynamics and impacts change over time. This special feature presents six studies that use literature reviews, field studies and experiments to examine long-term patterns in invader effects on species, communities and ecosystems. All studies in the special feature focus on data collected over multiple years and two studies provide data that cover multiple decades. One study provides a review and framework for understanding how invaders impact plant–mycorrhiza mutualisms and two studies focus on long-term ecosystem changes in response to invasion and fire. The next two studies examine how invaders respond to successional change and climate conditions over time, and the final study shows that invaders can shift selection regimes and the evolutionary trajectory of native plant populations. Synthesis. Articles in this special feature demonstrate changes in the dynamics of invasive plant populations and their community and ecosystem impacts over time. Together they illustrate that findings from a snapshot in time may poorly describe years-long outcomes of invasions, and they highlight the need for long-term studies of biological invasions.},

	Abstract = {Global conservation targets to reverse biodiversity declines and halt species extinctions are not being met despite decades of conservation action. However, a lack of measurable change in biodiversity indicators towards these targets is not necessarily a sign that conservation has failed; instead, temporal lags in species'responses to conservation action could be masking our ability to observe progress towards conservation success. Here we present our perspective on the influence of ecological time lags on the assessment of conservation success and review the principles of time lags and their ecological drivers. We illustrate how a number of conceptual species may respond to change in a theoretical landscape and evaluate how these responses might influence our interpretation of conservation success. We then investigate a time lag in a real biodiversity indicator using empirical data and explore alternative approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive time lags. Our proposal for setting and evaluating conservation targets is to use milestones, or interim targets linked to specific ecological mechanisms at key points in time, to assess whether conservation actions are likely to be working. Accounting for ecological time lags in biodiversity targets and indicators will greatly improve the way that we evaluate conservation successes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim  Earth observation (EO) products are a valuable alternative to spectral vegetation indices. We discuss the availability of EO products for analysing patterns in macroecology, particularly related to vegetation, on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Location  Global. Methods  We discuss four groups of EO products: land cover/cover change, vegetation structure and ecosystem productivity, fire detection, and digital elevation models. We address important practical issues arising from their use, such as assumptions underlying product generation, product accuracy and product transferability between spatial scales. We investigate the potential of EO products for analysing terrestrial ecosystems. Results  Land cover, productivity and fire products are generated from long-term data using standardized algorithms to improve reliability in detecting change of land surfaces. Their global coverage renders them useful for macroecology. Their spatial resolution (e.g. GLOBCOVER vegetation, 300 m; MODIS vegetation and fire, ≥ 500 m; ASTER digital elevation, 30 m) can be a limiting factor. Canopy structure and productivity products are based on physical approaches and thus are independent of biome-specific calibrations. Active fire locations are provided in near-real time, while burnt area products show actual area burnt by fire. EO products can be assimilated into ecosystem models, and their validation information can be employed to calculate uncertainties during subsequent modelling. Main conclusions  Owing to their global coverage and long-term continuity, EO end products can significantly advance the field of macroecology. EO products allow analyses of spatial biodiversity, seasonal dynamics of biomass and productivity, and consequences of disturbances on regional to global scales. Remaining drawbacks include inter-operability between products from different sensors and accuracy issues due to differences between assumptions and models underlying the generation of different EO products. Our review explains the nature of EO products and how they relate to particular ecological variables across scales to encourage their wider use in ecological applications.},

However, methods of recording and storing data captured from the field still require significant manual effort. Here, we introduce an open source, inexpensive, fully autonomous ecosystem monitoring unit for capturing and remotely transmitting continuous data streams from field sites over long time-periods. We provide a modular software framework for deploying various sensors, together with implementations to demonstrate proof of concept for continuous audio monitoring and time-lapse photography. We show how our system can outperform comparable technologies for fractions of the cost, provided a local mobile network link is available. The system is robust to unreliable network signals and has been shown to function in extreme environmental conditions, such as in the tropical rainforests of Sabah, Borneo. We provide full details on how to assemble the hardware, and the open-source software. Paired with appropriate automated analysis techniques, this system could provide spatially dense, near real-time, continuous insights into ecosystem and biodiversity dynamics at a low cost.},

Often, this information needs to be compressed for storage or transmission. Widely used devices called conductivity-temperature-depth satellite relay data loggers (CTD-SRDLs) sample time and depth at high resolution during a dive and then abstract the time–depth trajectory using a broken-stick model (BSM). This approximation method can summarize efficiently the curvilinear shape of a dive, using a piecewise linear shape with a small, fixed number of vertices, or break points.We present the process of abstracting dives using the BSM and quantify its performance, by measuring the uncertainty associated with the profiles it produces. We develop a method for obtaining a confidence zone and an index for the goodness-of-fit (dive zone index, DZI) for abstracted dive profiles. We validate our results with a case study using dives from elephant seals (Mirounga spp.). We use generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine whether the DZI can be used as a proxy for an absolute measure of fit and investigate the relationship between the DZI and the dive shape.We found a strong correlation between the residual sum of squares (RSS) for the difference between the detailed and abstracted profiles, and the DZI and maximum residual (R4), for dives resulting from CTD-SRDLs (69\% deviance explained). On its own, the DZI explained a lower percentage of deviance which was variable for abstracted dives with different numbers of break points. We also found evidence for systematic differences in the DZI for different dive shapes (65\% deviance explained).Although the proportional loss of information in the abstraction of time–depth dive profiles by BSM is high, what remains is sufficient to infer goodness-of-fit of the abstracted profile by reversing the abstraction process. Our results suggest that together the DZI and R4 can be used as a proxy for the RSS, and we present the method for obtaining these metrics for BSM-abstracted profiles.}},

abstract = {{In the last thirty years, the emergence and progression of biologging technology has led to great advances in marine predator ecology. Large databases of location and dive observations from biologging devices have been compiled for an increasing number of diving predator species (such as pinnipeds, sea turtles, seabirds and cetaceans), enabling complex questions about animal activity budgets and habitat use to be addressed. Central to answering these questions is our ability to correctly identify and quantify the frequency of essential behaviours, such as foraging. Despite technological advances that have increased the quality and resolution of location and dive data, accurately interpreting behaviour from such data remains a challenge, and analytical methods are only beginning to unlock the full potential of existing datasets. This review evaluates both traditional and emerging methods and presents a starting platform of options for future studies of marine predator foraging ecology, particularly from location and two-dimensional (time-depth) dive data. We outline the different devices and data types available, discuss the limitations and advantages of commonly-used analytical techniques, and highlight key areas for future research. We focus our review on pinnipeds - one of the most studied taxa of marine predators - but offer insights that will be applicable to other air-breathing marine predator tracking studies. We highlight that traditionally-used methods for inferring foraging from location and dive data, such as first-passage time and dive shape analysis, have important caveats and limitations depending on the nature of the data and the research question. We suggest that more holistic statistical techniques, such as state-space models, which can synthesise multiple track, dive and environmental metrics whilst simultaneously accounting for measurement error, offer more robust alternatives. Finally, we identify a need for more research to elucidate the role of physical oceanography, device effects, study animal selection, and developmental stages in predator behaviour and data interpretation.}},

abstract = {Abstract 1. The iconic European common skate (Dipturus batis) has been described as the first clear case of a fish species brought to the brink of extinction by commercial fishing. Its listing was upgraded to Critically Endangered on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. According to FAO fishery statistics, France is responsible for 60.2{\%} of the 502 tonnes reported as ‘D. batis' in the 2005 world landings. 2. Noticeable phenotypic differences within the species and inconsistencies in published data on its sexual maturation required careful re-examination of its taxonomy. Morphology, genetics, and life history reveal that two distinct species have been erroneously confused since the 1920s under the single scientific name D. batis. Here it is argued that they should be resurrected as two valid species. The common skate D. batis species-complex is split into two nominal species, the blue skate (provisionally called D. cf. flossada) and the flapper skate (D. cf. intermedia) with maximum lengths of 143.2 cm and 228.8 cm respectively. 3. This taxonomic confusion puts into question all previously accumulated data based on D. batis. Its endangered status highlights the need for an extensive reassessment of population collapses with accurately identified species. In 2006/2007 an extensive survey (4110 skates, 14.081 tonnes by weight) was conducted in the main French ports of the D. batis species-complex and relatives (D. oxyrinchus, D. nidarosiensis and Rostroraja alba) that are mixed together in landings under the names ‘D. batis' and ‘D. oxyrinchus'. 4. The survey reveals that official fishery statistics mask species-specific declines, due to the mislabelling of five species under only two landing names. Trends in landings since the 1960s and the life history of these species suggest a dramatic decline and collapse of the spawning stock, preventing the recovery of relict populations. 5. The risk of extinction of these depleted species may be higher than previously assessed and might be unavoidable without immediate and incisive conservation action.

In Europe dramatic population declines have taken place in common skate (Dipturus batis L.), one of the largest demersal fish in regional shelf seas, leading to extirpations from substantial parts of its former range. Here we report the discovery of cryptic species in common skate collected from the northeast Atlantic continental shelf. Data from nuclear microsatellite markers indicated two clearly distinct clades and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences demonstrated monophyly of each one of them. Capture locations showed evidence of strong spatial segregation, with one taxon occurring mainly in waters off the southern British Isles and around Rockall, while the other was restricted to more northerly shelf waters. These apparently cryptic species showed overlapping substrate and depth preferences, but distributional limits were closely related to temperature gradients, potentially indicating thermal limits to their distributions. This discovery of hidden diversity within a large, critically endangered marine vertebrate demonstrates how marine biodiversity can be underestimated, even in such a relatively well-studied and heavily exploited region. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society},

abstract = {Abstract In order to evaluate if marine protected areas (MPAs) can be expected to confer conservation benefits to large, mobile marine species it is important to assess their site fidelity and habitat ranging patterns. The flapper skate (Dipterus cf. intermedia) is a large, threatened elasmobranch for which MPAs are being considered on the west coast of Scotland. To inform MPA establishment, a multiannual mark–recapture programme, a year-long static array acoustic study and an archival tagging study of flapper skate were undertaken. Capture–mark–recapture (CMR) modelling of 280 individuals indicated significant heterogeneity in the recapture rate suggesting the region contained a mixture of site-attached (resident) and vagrant (transient) individuals. The analysis estimated that 100–400 resident individuals were present in the study area. The number of transient individuals was estimated at around 25{\%} of all those tagged. The average annual survival probability of resident individuals was estimated to be 0.64. The acoustic study of 20 individuals demonstrated that over half were resident on a day-by-day basis for months at a time. Three individuals were detected over the entire year. Two individuals moved away immediately after tagging and over half moved out of the study area in the springtime. Three data storage tags revealed that resident individuals utilized most of the available depth habitat (6–205 m) in the area and occasionally visited deeper areas outside the immediate study area. The results indicate that the establishment of a MPA would confer conservation benefits to flapper skate in the area. Management should consider all depths in the study area, areas beyond the study site, and alternative conservation measures such as technical gear measures for fisheries. This study has implications for the conservation and management of similar long-lived, mobile marine species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Crown copyright.
