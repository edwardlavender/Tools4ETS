#' @title Tools4ETS: Tools for Ecological Timeseries.
#' @author Edward Lavender
#'
#' @description Tools for Ecological Timeseries (Tools4ETS) is package designed to facilitate the simulation, processing, exploration, visualisation and modelling of (primarily ecological) timeseries data (simply defined as data collected through time). This package has been particularly inspired by high-resolution depth timeseries data, for example, of the kind collected by archival/data storage tags.
#'
#' @section Data Visualisation:
#' A set of functions is used for visualising timeseries data, across different factor levels, in relation to covariates and at different scales. This includes an interactive Shiny-Dashboard interface for exploring timeseries.
#'
#' @section Data Processing:
#' A set of functions is used for processing timeseries data. This includes the identification and description of recapture events (for depth timeseries), flagging independent sections of timeseries, thinning timeseries and breaking timeseries.
#'
#' @section Simulations:
#' A set of functions is used to simulate timeseries, either from a generalised additive model or de novo timeseries and, in the latter case, to facilitate the comparison of simulated versus modelled relationships under different scenarios. This includes an interactive Shiny-Dashboard interface for simulating and modelling depth timeseries using generalised additive models under different conditions.
